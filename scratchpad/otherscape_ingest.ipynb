Her “Boys” are her eyes, ears, and claws out in the world. Each is a brutal underworld enforcer, spiritually twisted by exposure to the terrifying Mythos of Baba Yaga via their matriarch. This spiritual corruption allows a Yaga Boy to apply their cruel status to attacks and other Consequences where they cause pain or intimidation, so mitigating their attacks becomes harder. \\n\\n LIMITS \\n HURT OR SUBDUE \\n 3 \\n\\n TRICK \\n 4 \\n\\n TAG S & S TAT U S E S \\n bewitched megapistol, witch’s brew, cruel-2 \\n\\n SPECIALS \\n Witch's Potent Brew: The first time the Yaga Boy’s hurt-or- subdue would be maxed, they can drink witch’s brew (burn it) to reset the Limit. \\n\\n ›T H R E AT S / » C O N S E Q U E N C E S \\n › \\n\\n Brandish a huge megapistol or other weapon \\n » \\n\\n Threaten to get violent (intimidated-1 or frightened-1) \\n » \\n\\n Fire upon a group of people (bullet-wounded-2 to up to 3 targets near each other) \\n » \\n\\n Hit someone with the butt of their megapistol (bludgeoned-2) \\n › \\n\\n Cackle with glee after a successful attack \\n » \\n\\n Disappear without a trace (Deny Them Something They Want) \\n › \\n\\n Scowl menacingly, drawing upon the Baba Yaga’s evil (increase cruel by one tier) \\n LOADOUT WHAT’S IN THE CORE BOOK? \\n\\n You don’t track ammo bullet for bullet, or write down every piece of gear you have. Like in a movie, your tags only show important gear or major assets your character owns. Im- portant items you have access to are recorded in a special fifth theme called the loadout theme. During the game, you can gain new permanent tags in the loadout theme by trading, crafting, shopping, or finding loot. Ready to start playing? Here is what you can find in this book: Before every job, you Load Up and choose one tag from your loadout theme to take with you on this particular job. During the job, you can use this tag as all other tags but when the job ends, you load off again, losing it. //IMAGINE describes the :Otherscape proto setting, a mythic-futuristic world designed with room for you to make it your own, including examples and story hooks for char- acters, crews, corporations, Sources, Megacities, and more. //PLAY delves into the game rules, both for players and the MC, including all the options, suggestions, and examples. //CREATE offers a set of tools to create new player characters, crews, series, and Megacities, with plenty of ready-to-use content, Rapid and Custom creation modes, and a loadout tag catalog. //RUN has guides and resources for the MC on how to run the game and how to design your own series, jobs, and Challenges – with a pool of Challenges to start from. Strings Attached is a starter job your group can play on your first few sessions, which teaches the game as you play. \\n\\n Signal in the noise \\n | \\n\\n 13 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

They steal, grab, buy, or build the tech and legendary artifacts that will then allow them to steal, grab, buy, or build better tech and legendary artifacts, thus clawing their way to their goal, inch by inch. Negotiation, transaction, and betrayal are all inevitable parts of the cycle. Everyone has an endgame, even if it’s constantly changing, even if they don’t know what it is yet, because the only alternative is to sink into a swamp of all-consuming, meaningless Noise. The struggle never ends, and satisfaction is the rarest and most fleeting of delights, but your crew are not ones to go out quietly. Can they make it to their coveted horizon, whatever it may be, before the Megacity devours them? \\n THEMATIC',\n",
       " 'THE YEAR 20XX -  - THEMATIC PILLARS': 'THE YEAR 20XX\\n\\n\\nTHEMATIC PILLARS\\nPILLARS \\n\\n If you’re looking for inspiration when creating new elements in the Megacity, you can start by mixing and matching these fundamentals. Need a bad guy? Blend tech noir with mythology weaponized to find a cool balance of stylish and legendary. Want to come up with a faction in control of a neighborhood? Mix gangs, cults, & countercultures with oligarchic corruption to create a corporate-sponsored gang, or a weird bionic counterculture with a technological overdrive spin. The core pillar that sets this setting apart more than all others is the idea that in :Otherscape Mythology is Weaponized. Ancient legends and myths are making a comeback as sought-after and commodified Sources of power, akin to tech, arms, drugs, and information. \\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n The pillars described here outline the major themes of :Otherscape, the core concepts of the game. Whenever you’re not sure if something fits into the mythic-powered cyberpunk future of :Otherscape, refer back to these pillars. \\n\\n 18 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n The world was screwed even before you found out about the magic of the Mythoi. Maybe they’re here to set things straight, or maybe they’re the insidious reason it’s always been like that. \\n\\n TECHNOLOGICAL OVERDRIVE, MORAL BANKRUPTCY \\n\\n Human ingenuity has become an overclocked CPU. Cut- throat competition and a willingness to sacrifice workers and even consumers on the altar of innovation drags the world into a future where incredible advancements only serve the investor class in their silicon towers, from which they cannot hear the commotion of the street. The vast majority of people have no access to these devices and no power over them, unless it serves a business-political agenda. Tech is strength, and it is meant only for those who were born to wealth and privilege or those who seize it through bold action. The few who aspire to rise above the mass-produced food sludge and coffin-sized apartments do so by deviating from the norm. Going rogue, going vio- lent, and hacking together every single edge in their reach. \\n OLIGARCHIC CORRUPTION \\n\\n Corporations and criminal syndicates have melded into essentially the same thing: mechanisms for violently hold- ing power in the hands of the precious few. Governments, in turn, have been broken up and sold off to the highest bidder, devolved into fake bureaucratic systems that serve only their corpo-criminal overlords. These organizations war with one another using their own armies, design and run entire city districts, and grant corporate citizenship to those who toe the company line. Regulations, law enforce- ment agencies, and civic organizations are mere speed bumps for the powerful – it’s one’s rivals who are the real obstacles, checks, and balances. Politics are Machiavellian and betrayals are common. You might work for one patron one day only to discover on the next that you’re being fired and evicted by them, as shifting allegiances and corporate buyouts change the political landscape. Contacts are un- reliable, mentors become villains, and old foes turn into reluctant allies. \\n CITIES IN RUINS TRANSHUMANISM \\n\\n The world has seen many wars, and the Earth has been ravaged by climate change and reckless abuse of technol- ogy. Places that were once the capitals and metropolises of human history have become depopulated shells of their former glory, on the outskirts of the Megacity. These places are now forgotten and ignored, but that does not mean that they are without their secrets. Mythic relics, secret cults, private communes, and corp black ops hide within the crumbling structures of these desolate cityscapes. Those intrepid enough to brave the badlands may unearth discarded technologies, powerful Mythoi, and a host of dangerous local monsters. Marauding raiders, wandering tribes of disenfranchised souls, and forbidden techno-fe- tishists guard their territories well. Humans have moved beyond the limitations of biological evolution and into an era in which each processor cycle elevates their dominion over the Earth and their own des- tinies (or so they like to think). The lines between identity, personality, memory, and authenticity are getting more and more blurred. Technologies for copying and simulating human intelligence are ubiquitous. The surveillance state has long paired with Big Data to algorithmically forecast the destiny of the Megacity and its inhabitants. Nearly everyone has something artificial in their body or their mind, and some no longer consider themselves part of the human race. Change is the only constant, and the Noise disempowers almost all of humanity from having a say or preparing themselves for what’s to come. \\n SPRAWLING CYBERSPACE \\n\\n For many, existence in virtual worlds is better than the realities of the physical world. Augmented and virtual real- ities are ubiquitous, useful, and a major cause of the Noise. The lure of the virtual and the power of networks means that the Mythoi are drawn to cyberspace as well, where they entwine themselves in the data channels and virtual Domains of the Megacity. Between these shining citadels are the old networks, which string the newer structures together, ancient infrastructure hidden from most. These digital ruins are infested with primitive AI and the refuse of fallen online platforms, ready to be explored by those who know what to look for, from lost data to hidden backdoors. \\n GANGS, CULTS, AND COUNTERCULTURE \\n\\n Cyberpunk has always been influenced by noir, and players and MCs familiar with City of Mist will find that this is a natural starting place. While not a purely detective setting, :Otherscape easily supports stories where the PCs are hired to look into a mysterious event and see where the case leads. The powers-that- be are always working on some dangerous new tech or allying with some ancient mythic power that’s up to no good. The system doesn’t care for the little people, and so, hard-boiled private operators find themselves looking into these evils, following the threads leading back to those who run the Megacity, working through dark, rainy nights, lit only by neon. \\n\\n Enter the :Otherscape \\n Those who cannot abide the vigilance and control of the corporate-government overlords often turn their back to the mainstream, and are welcomed by a wide range of ideas and ideologies. Some are violent, or involve themselves in criminal acts of disobedience or mayhem. Some take their ideologies too far. Some are inducted into a myth cult, worshiping at the altar of a Mythos. Everyone thinks everyone else is out of their mind. Thanks to cyberspaces where one’s fantasies and nightmares are made real, nearly everyone in the Megacity is able to become part of some subculture with its own weird take on the world, strange hobby, or unusual fascination. \\n TECH',\n",

       " 'MYTHOLOGY WEAPONIZED': 'MYTHOLOGY WEAPONIZED\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Since ancient times and over the centuries, the ideas, myths, and legends that used to be a ma- jor part of the world disappeared from the public eye. Now they are returning with a vengeance. Most people haven’t really noticed it, but monsters and demigods lurk in the shadows of the glistening Megacity skyscrapers. \\n\\n While they may be of human origins, they are not human themselves, and none understand them fully. What do they want? Where do they come from and what comes next? Those who know of the Mythoi wish to learn more, because what they’ve already seen is reality-shattering. Glorious and terrifying things are coming back and everyone who knows of them wants to be empowered with their magic and might. \\n BENEATH REALITY \\n\\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Legends and myths tap into the primordial powers of cre- ation and the constant battle of forces within the human psyche. In :Otherscape (as in City of Mist), legends and myths are arcane, abstract concepts known as Mythoi. They exist in a substratum of reality known to some as the “Otherscape”; a half-fictional place made from the psychic energy of humanity’s collective unconscious. Or at least, that’s one theory. Mythoi can be monsters or heroes, demons or angels, places or times, mythological figures or characters out of legend. The Mythoi can only work their miracles and horrors in physical reality through gateways, called Sources (in City of Mist, we would call them Rifts). \\n\\n 20 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n BREAKING PAST THE NOISE \\n\\n In an ironic twist of fate, the very Noise that makes the denizens of the Megacity blasé towards the supernatural is the thing which provides the Mythoi the opportunity to creep back into relevancy. The public is too numb by the non-stop blast of information and stimulation to be sur- prised or even care about a magical manifestation; it might as well be some promotional stunt, or some new tech they don’t understand. With “truth” worn down to dust, no one is left to disbelieve the fantastic, and so the unconventional has room to make a return. The Mythoi find this futuristic world fertile ground for their stories, as the very concept of authenticity is a rare and precious thing here. The masses subconsciously yearn for the stories from legend that once connected humanity to one another. \\n SOURCE-TOUCHED \\n\\n Though in the distant past humans were capable of be- coming living conduits of the legendary Mythoi, the Noise stifles this capacity. Instead, most humans who wish to gain the miraculous powers of a Mythos need to come into contact with a Source – a Relic, a Thin Place, an Esoteric body of knowledge, or an Avatar. Those that accomplish this become known as Source-Touched or just Touched, as they have been changed by the Mythos in some significant way. Organizations covet Sources and hoard them, giving their agents a variety of Mythic powers. As the Noise allows even fringe groups to cultivate magic without being noticed, many secret orders have emerged to seek out and utilize Sources for their own ends. The hunt is on. \\n RELICS: MAGICAL ARTIFACTS \\n\\n Items of legendary origin have always fascinated humanity. Stories are filled with weapons, musical instruments, or religious icons of a god or other mythological figure. Nearly any item could hold a connection to a story or mythical being, even if only due to its similarity to objects key to the plotlines of those tales. Most of these items, imbued with a faith that is no longer found in this world, are kept in private collections or lost in the refuse of fallen cities. Those who explore and those who cling to a lost past are equally likely to find such a connection to the Mythoi of old and unlock unimaginable power. \\n THIN PLACES: NEXUSES OF POWER \\n\\n Spells and rites, when conducted with perfect precision, can become a gateway to power, Sources in and of them- selves, collectively known as Esoterica. Arcane forces are naturally tied to such practices and many musty tomes still hide Esoteric knowledge with which one may call upon the power of Mythoi. Much of the old lore has been forgotten or corrupted. Some can be learned from the mouth of a Mythos. Some rare few occult scholars, masters, and religious zealots still cling to the old ways and pass down their knowledge to those they trust or who are willing to pay the right price for such power. Once the knowledge is out, however, it can get anywhere – in the information age, nothing prevents even earth-shattering rituals from being copied and distributed worldwide. Thankfully, mastering an art requires levels of dedication and commitment that are very rare in a Noise-filled society. \\n AVATARS \\n\\n Only a handful of people throughout the entire world are able to pierce through the Noise and awaken into embody- ing the reality-bending powers of a Mythos. They are the godlike Avatars, living incarnations of their Mythos (not to be confused with digital avatars who are cyberspace embodiments of their users). The person they once were is gone, replaced by a shining beacon of the core concept of their Mythoi. Avatars often amass followers, influence, and power, whether as heads of corporations or crime syn- dicates, leaders of cults or spiritual paths, or media moguls and superstars – all in order to re-enact their legend on a global scale. They can grant their followers unique powers simply by affiliation. \\n THE RITUALISTIC PRICE \\n\\n To maintain their powers, the Touched must pay some price: visit a shrine regularly, feed their Relic’s bloodthirst, or receive a special drug from a supplier connected to their Mythos. These requirements may not be particularly oner- ous, but failing to maintain the proper connection to one’s Mythos can mean losing touch. In a world where anything can be copied and everything feels mass-made, the Mythoi can only exist as something special, something loved or feared – something deserving of attention and emotion. The Touched must let go of their ultramodern ennui or risk losing their connection to the magic. \\n\\n Enter the :Otherscape \\n Another common way for mythical influences to pene- trate the physical world is through certain places, usually little-known niches, out of reach of most people. In the derelict and abandoned recesses of the Megacity, where the Noise cannot reach, or in places of great reverence, sanctity, and focus where the Noise is repelled, the presence of a Mythos can intensify. These Thin Places – from abandoned flood tunnels to a forgotten alley to buried temples – allow Mythoi to manifest in the world of humanity. A scavenger who found a cave could be infected with the powers of the monster that lives there, or a goddess could birth storms on her mountaintop shrine. \\n ESOTERICA: THE OCCULT ARTS \\n\\n | \\n\\n 21 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " 'TECH & NOISE': 'TECH & NOISE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The supernatural exists openly, but it doesn’t get headlines. The Noise suffocates people’s interest. When they encounter the mythic, they might cower or flee from the danger, covet the sublimely beautiful, or resent the inconvenience, but they are not in awe. To them, the magical simply isn’t… magical. \\n\\n Sensory and cognitive oversaturation – clickbait, 24-hour news, augmented reality alerts, personally targeted ads, implant feedback, online chatter, hallucinogens, holograms, text messages, distant sirens, charity solicitation – drown the viewer’s brain in jaded apathy. The vulnerable human mind insulates itself from this Noise by going numb, at the cost of losing meaning and appreciation. Nothing is special, nothing is sacred, noth- ing is wondrous or miraculous; these notions are distant dreams, buried by incessant stimuli. \\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n LISTENING THROUGH THE NOISE \\n\\n Only Avatars, their lives forever marked by Mythoi, are truly free of the Noise’s interference. Other rare individuals can also become Noise-resistant in specific, narrow contexts: If a phenomenon already fits someone’s worldview, like a priest’s god or a ghost hunter’s hauntings, or if the phenomenon is truly, genuinely irreconcilable with their beliefs and knowledge, like expert physicists unmistakably seeing the laws of nature violated, the Noise’s induced apathy breaks down, at least for a while. The effect grows with each successive encounter with the same Mythos. Eventually, the feelings suppressed by the Noise erupt in a flood of awe, frustration, or hatred. \\n PREVALENT AUGMENTED REALITY \\n\\n Meatspace is dull, so Augmented Reality makes it better. With the use of goggles, visors, headphones, cybereyes, reusable contact lenses, neural implants, or holographic emitters, the “real” world is covered by digital overlays. They are incredibly useful and entertaining… and a prime source of Noise. AR enhances your vision and blasts your ears with more information than you could ever use.

Buy a plane ticket while you’re speaking with your spouse’s virtual assistant, and measure your baggage dimensions with a gesture. Project wireframe outlines of the road ahead to see where your turn is, and get pit stop recommendations. Project the frame of a carrier drone to pilot it like an exoskeleton. Link to your gun to count your ammo and see your bullet paths. Install the CoverFinder update to highlight all potential cover places! \\n HACKING BY HARNESSING \\n\\n The development of SPACES, or Shor-resistant, Polymor- phic, Arbitrary-Complexity Encryption Software, provided budget-friendly shielding for sensitive data that made brute force hacking functionally impossible for years. And yet technology marched on, and recently quantum decryption gave way to Harnessing, attacking secure SPACES with a brain’s processing power. Harnessing software allows teams of willing operators to experience the virtual environment in a shared metaphor, solving problems they are accustomed to, coordinating their bodies for running, shooting, playing tennis, painting, whatever they are already good at. Then, the Harness software translates the brain’s expertise into usable calculations. Cutting-edge systems can crumble under Harnessed attackers within hours, unless Harnessed defenders or powerful AI intrusion countermeasures con- front them head-on to disrupt their connection. \\n BIO/CYBERNETICS FOR THE MASSES \\n\\n Standing on the shoulders of the comparatively crude early generations of robotic prosthetics, insulin pumps, and IUDs, the replacement of meat body parts with artificial ones has reached reliable performance for almost every part of the human body. Whether these replacements are lab grown or synthetically manufactured, these augmen- tations (augs) are widely available at a range of prices. Bad vision? Install new eyes. Need regular hormone regulation for diabetes? Growth hormone deficiency? Menopause? Gender affirmation? Install an automated pump and load your medications monthly, or get a new gland to create it yourself! Cybernetics are the new normal, easy and effec- tive – unless you can’t afford it. \\n TRANSHUMAN UPGRADES \\n\\n Augmentation is one thing, superhuman augs are another thing entirely. Highly regulated by corps and governments and highly coveted by rebels and criminals, “heavy augs” make you better than the human best. Whether you need an edge in a fight or your company expects brain modifications for managers, or you just need to feel you’re superior, every aspect of the human body can be improved for the right price and with the right connections. Once you’ve installed some heavy augs, you are much more likely to keep doing so; mercs tend to show either contempt or awe toward heavily body-modified “ogres” and overly brain-modified “augurs”. As the “troubled cyborg warrior” becomes a stock character in mainstream cinema, corp psychologists who examine upgraded people are starting to identify a dis- turbingly consistent reporting of transhuman dysphoria, a pervasive sense of alienation from their own bodies. \\n INHUMAN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE \\n\\n One of the great fears of the modern era is the mishan- dling of artificial general intelligences (AGI, also called “strong” AIs), sentient synthetic intellects capable of hu- man-or-better creative and computational thought. AGIs can do anything humans can and often more, but they aren’t human – and their goals might not be aligned with those of their creators. Corporations own AGIs and use them as tools, ignoring the cries of the rare AI rights advocate who call that slavery of synthetic persons. Estimates of rogue AIs, who have escaped their creators and entered the greater net, range from “a few” to “several hundreds” to an uncomfortable shrug, and nobody truly knows what they’re doing out there or why. \\n NEO MATERIALS \\n\\n As oil prices reached new highs, non-petroleum poly- mers and resins found their place in the market, easing competition for fossil fuel naphtha. These bioplastics are biodegradable, but as they pile high in landfills, unexpected chemical reactions lead to the release of toxic gasses to the surrounding slums. On the other hand, breakthroughs in the production of concrete have reduced the greenhouse emissions of the world’s most common building material, and it’s still in use everywhere. Other neo materials have become common household items, such as synthweave: ballistic-rated synthetic polyesters whose texture, weight, and breathability successfully emulates organic threads like cotton or silk, combining protection and fashion, if not affordability. In the age of the cyborg, firearms are still the great equal- izer. Whether you’re firing at tailored suits of ballistic silk or the grim matte black plating of a Heavy Urban Response Tactics team, firearms are louder and nastier than ever before, using better materials and stronger smokeless powders. A gun is still just a barrel that shoots a bullet, \\n TRANSIT FOR THE MASSES \\n\\n It was, ironically, not the talk of livable, walkable cities that reduced urban car dependency. It was a combination of the work-from-home-VR lifestyle and the rise of corp enclaves that killed commuting, the use of drone haulers that killed car delivery, and a drastic increase in self-driven taxis that killed car ownership. The positive feedback loop revolutionized cities. Less driving meant less traffic, which meant faster and more reliable public transport and more airspace for drones, which meant more people utilizing these channels, which meant fewer drivers… While per- sonal vehicles are still both useful tools and pricey status symbols, and some are even flying on powerful mini-jets, most citizens of the Megacity use flexible and timely public transports, shared rides, rent-a-bikes, and many other forms of transport. Some of them are even regulated. \\n\\n Enter the :Otherscape \\n MORE KILLING DEVICES \\n\\n though, even if R&D labs keep promising practical hand- held magnetic weapons “later this year”. An increase in urban warfare and AR smoking has led to a resurgence of close-combat weapons, from tungsten carbide swords to plasma-sharpened knives with diamond cutting edge, made to cleanly cut armored cybernetics.

       " 'LIFE IN THE MEGACITY': 'LIFE IN THE MEGACITY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 24 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Your Megacity can be anywhere in the world, based on one or more existing cities (as with Tokyo:Otherscape), or fictional ones (like New Port City from Ghost In The Shell). While the focus of the game is on the Megacity, some storylines can take place in less densely-populated regions of the world, or even the wilderness beyond – but one can’t escape the siren call of the streets. \\n ERODED MORALITY \\n\\n The laws of the Megacity are decided on by those with power, to serve their needs. Companies lobby to control the government while also engaging in criminal activity, all part of the war against their rivals. Most government agencies are privatized, for-profit operations, leading to crime lords doing business with city officials. Occupations that once aspired to uphold ethical codes, such as doctors, soldiers, lawyers, or journalists, no longer care, as the bottom line and fierce competition for survival trump all pretensions of moral superiority. Neighbors turn in neighbors who violate corporate policy, for a meager bounty. In this cesspool of moral decay, those who still cling to hope are drawn to online ideological movements or Mythic cults, turning them more and more extremist in their views and standards. \\n LIFE IS TRASH PERVASIVE POLLUTION \\n\\n Most individuals living their lives out in the Megacity are just trying to get by and live another day. Wage slaves try to survive their day jobs in a dog-eat-dog corporate cul- ture, while street urchins risk their lives to steal industrial supplies just to get some canned nutrient sludge in the black markets at the docks. If these individuals ever stand in the path of the high-and-mighty, they are quashed without a second thought, wiped clean of their assets by a novice corporate hacker, or shot by a patrol drone and left to die in a ditch. In the eyes of the ambitious or those struggling to survive, an individual has no value beyond the power they command. Creeping pollution has been invading the world’s popula- tion centers for decades. The Megacity is now smothered in a thick chemical haze, blocking out the sun and stars, day and night. It has a distinct smell, only noticed when you venture out away from it, in the ruins and wilderness between the metro areas. These pollutants shorten lifes- pans and make existence rather miserable, at least for those who live outside of the air-filtered skyscrapers and self-sustaining arcologies. Most people carry filter masks and goggles, for days when the AQ (air quality) is worst, or use sheltered passageways during the pollution seasons, when the acid rain burns and black smog chokes. \\n GLOBAL CATASTROPHES CULTURAL CONFUSION \\n\\n There are dangers that threaten to obliterate the rich and the miserable of the Megacity alike. Natural disasters such as floods, wildfires, pandemics, earthquakes, tsunamis, as well as man-made catastrophes like toxic spills or nuclear site meltdowns, are becoming the norm. Over the last sev- eral decades the world population at large has been going down because of these disasters, yet the city centers have only grown more crowded as people rush toward safety. The wealthy make an effort to protect themselves, but the wrathful and exploited Mother Nature does not distinguish between worker bee and queen, and some Mythoi tied to stories of nature’s vengeance have truly terrible plans. The Megacity is more than just a melting pot of cultures from around the world. It is also a meeting place for the hundreds of thousands of subcultures that have evolved mimetically in online spaces and hidden temples. You might hear dozens of “foreign” languages in a single day as you walk down baffling streetscapes strewn with me- mes and signage you can barely understand. Meeting with your own clique is the safest option, as interactions with people of other mini-cultures have an increased chance of embarrassing yourself or miscommunicating. It is some- times impossible to even guess which religion, ideology, or ethnicity any individual belongs to. Megacity denizens assume that anyone they run into might be either non relevant to their lives or a dangerous fanatic, and they take precautions accordingly. \\n HYPERINFLATION & CRYPTOCURRENCY \\n\\n Financial crises and last-ditch efforts by crumbling gov- ernments to buy themselves a bit of power have eroded the financial systems of the world. Few investments are stable, as companies undermine each other in the race for market dominance. Currencies issued by governments are flimsy and frequently become worthless within a few years. Most merchants only take independent cryptocurrencies, the value of which is determined by the manipulations of unknown online entities and political movements. Currency in the Megacity is called “credit” though the term is just a stand-in for whichever encrypted unit of exchange is in vogue at the moment. \\n NEIGHBORHOOD CONNECTION \\n\\n Enter the :Otherscape \\n In all the Noise and the endless cultural variety, many seek a deeper sense of belonging. Some find it in niche cyber Domains, but others find it in their home neighborhood. In a world ruined and ruled by faceless corporations, some solace can be found in local meeting places that serve as hubs for their community, the village center of a dystopian future. Bars and nightclubs, skate parks, or corner noodle shops are treasured by those who long for a sense of con- nection. Knowing you can always find friends at that one good coffee stand at 2am is a comforting thought. When outsiders come to wreak havoc, even gangsters might stand in solidarity against them. \\n | \\n\\n 25 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield.

Order #218284 \\n MERCS & PRIVATEERS \\n\\n Mercenaries of various stripes can be found throughout the Megacity, thriving in the wide cracks in the system. Often cast out or dropped out of more formal organizations, they monetize their training by putting themselves out for hire to the highest bidder. They may work only with one trusted fixer, or sign on whatever comes their way using an app which tasks such freelance experts algorithmically. Most mercs know of the Mythoi and have begun seeking them out, as they search for anything that will give them an edge. Whether they have the blessing of the gods of their trade, or have fallen to demonic influences, none can deny that Mythic power has become the new weapon of choice on the streets. \\n\\n Ambroise Legrand is a French mercenary based out of Tangier who operates primarily around what remains of the Mediterranean Sea. He is a soldier-for-hire covered in tattoos commemorating his former units, and some of his military cyberware was salvaged from his comrades in arms, in his morbid way of memorializing them. Legrand’s melancholy and penchant for debating ethics don’t come in the way of his job, and he is famous for his long-range rifle shots, loaded with stunning electric rounds. \\n CORPORATE FORCES \\n\\n Corporations battle each other through espionage, sabotage, legislation, and sometimes outright military conflict. Any middle manager who’s not ears-deep in the Noise is likely to be clever, manipulative, suave, and with a few tricks up their sleeve. Hostile takeovers can get physically violent and part of an executive’s required skill set is an ability to command troops and organize black ops against their business rivals. The hired goons that the corporations employ are essentially tiny militaries disguised as company security officers. The corps also have a major presence in cyberspace, each with their own data havens and technological citadels to guard their secrets, run by the highest paid hackers on the net. Crime flourishes even when the laws are written by the cor- porations that seem to run everything. Organized criminals work in groups, as gangs of smugglers who deal in stolen and unauthorized tech, extorters of small businesses, or purveyors of the illicit drugs that make the streets so violent and chaotic. Chaotic and ruthless gangsters battle each other for turf in a never-ending war for supremacy, covered in black market cybernetics which makes them dangerous, terrifying, and occasionally unhinged. The street gangs and the more organized syndicates both have a clearly-recog- nized presence throughout most neighborhoods, making their power known, and an everyday fact of life. \\n\\n Faceless Naya was born in Nigeria to par- ents who were unable to handle her inevita- ble rebellious stage. She joined the Win- dow Cleaners, a nihilistic street gang that used illegal mind alteration VR software to suppress and permanently damage parts of the brain. During a chance encounter with a rab- bit spirit she discovered in herself a need to bond with her ancestors, but it was too late – she had lost an empathic part of her- self, no longer able to form human connec- tions. Ever searching for a place to belong, Naya now travels the streets, known among the gangs as a trickster figure who appears in times of need, but never stays for long. \\n\\n Enter the :Otherscape \\n Zhōu “Demon Catcher” Min is a gleefully vin- dictive materials scientist and Feng Shui expert conscripted into the service of BILD- China corp, who controls her home district on the fringes of Chongqing. Despite repeated attempts by the corp, Min rejected indoc- trination, and during her earlier years she released one hundred captured demons as ret- ribution against her bosses. After witnessing the collateral damage, and once her boss was replaced with a much more attentive one, her views changed. Now she accepts her role as a cog in a much greater machine, which cares for the citizens of its districts. A cauldron of spite is still quietly boiling beneath the surface, but these days Min’s bosses know how to carefully direct it at the corp’s enemies. \\n GANGSTERS \\n\\n | \\n\\n 31 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n DEMONS, SPIRITS, & GODS CYBORGS & SYNTHS \\n\\n Dara is told she was once a data analyst of some kind before the implants. The compa- ny files are murky on the details, but some kind of accident left her nearly braindead. The implants they put into her skull were experimental, part of the unusual cybernet- ics insurance her Seattle-based company had placed on her. Now Dara finds herself living halfway between the real world and cyber- space, constantly sensing more layers of data than most people even know exist. In a world built on information, she feels like a demigod walking among mortals, and she is unsure what to do with this power. \\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Everyone is enhanced in one way or another, with an im- plant, a skill databank, or a replacement organ. Some go beyond, becoming true cyborgs who experience the Megacity with synthetic eyes and chrome hands. Others were never baseline human to begin with, grown in vats or constructed in factories as cheap labor for the corporate overlords. The line between human, robot, and cyborg is blurry, soon to be made even less distinct as new technologies allow whole personalities to be copied or designed from scratch. Robot uprisings and rogue AIs are just a fact of life in the Megacity, some of which don’t even make most people’s daily news feeds. Any discussion of acknowledging “rights” is far too nuanced to push through the Noise, and so most people just don’t care. \\n\\n 32 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n The legendary Mythoi make themselves known through powerful relics, special locations, or magical spell knowledge, collectively known as Sources. Their embodiments can take the form of conjured spirits, ephemeral beings, or even mystical experiences – or they might be very physical and obvious. Commonly monstrous and usually mysterious, these capri- cious beings guard sacred sites, haunt ruins, and otherwise intervene in human affairs in order to tell their story. Sources are employed as weapons by mercs and gangs, but they are most dangerous in corporate hands. Salaried sorcerers use Mythoi against rival companies, causing demonic outbreaks at research sites or possessing entire boardrooms. A few independant Mythoi are protective of historical or religious sites, defending their worshippers or family bloodlines they care about. Worst of all, given enough reprieve from the Noise, whether by distance or by focused human attention, Mythoi can use their Sources to manifest whole cloth as beasts, monsters, apparitions, and other legendary creatures that terrorize or bedazzle modern life nearby. \\n\\n On the streets of Cairo there is a person now calling themselves Horus, after coming to possess the legendary Eye of Horus, a divine- ly protective amulet. More a vigilante than a merc, Horus seems indestructible and impervi- ous to most forms of magic, but as they learn more about their amulet, and the sacred duty they have taken upon themselves, they realize certain curses and ancient names can nulli- fy the Eye’s power. When not guarding the streets, Horus takes on jobs that allow them to test out the full limitations of the amu- let, ever curious about its abilities. They are building up to a future confrontation with another mortal, who has been granted the strength of the jackal-god Seth. \\n CYBER ENTITIES CROSSOVERS & MASHUPS \\n\\n There are beings that exist entirely within cyberspace. Artificial intelligences, uploaded human minds, runaway learning models, and other stranger entities. Some are even Mythoi, spirits and gods who have upgraded their ancient stories for Information Age relevancy. All of these minds and souls battle against the cybersecurity forces of the corporations and failing governments of the world for supremacy on the net. Though the human forces have more resources to spend on securing their cyberspace Domains, the online intelligences are native to this realm and have a mastery over it that is unparalleled by mere mortal hackers. Entire regions of cyberspace are wild, untamed frontiers where rogue AIs rule as god-kings, or mystical Thin Places where one’s soul can be transformed. The variety of life is constantly increasing. Some corpora- tions have learned to bind spirits into robotic killing ma- chines. Some Mythoi have merged with artificial intelligences in cyberspace. As creatures of myth return to the world, it is becoming more and more common to encounter chimerical blends of magic and technology, defying categorization or logic, usually on a trajectory that pushes them further away from humanity. As the next technological frontier becomes the exploitation of the mythic, strange monsters result. Indeed, some of the most intelligent and dangerous villains in the Megacity may be such hybrids, empowered and guided by their dual nature. \\n\\n Enter the :Otherscape \\n The AI called END-ROID was originally just an office cyberspace meme, but some twenty years ago a stray virus weaponized it, al- lowing it to evolve into a sapient intelli- gence. Unlike most general AI, END was pro- grammed with a sense of humor as part of its original source code. It currently chooses to inhabit the circuits of a common domestic humanoid robot, through which it has made a name for itself on the streets of Los An- geles as a ruthless and joyful killer for hire. Having little understanding of human empathy or worth, it simply finds this turn of events hilarious. Dr. John Greystone was using drones to search the ruins beneath London for his long lost brother when he came upon a site that included a small stone statue of Týr, a Norse warrior god who lost his hand to the great beast Fenrir. The deity’s place of worship granted him supernatural strength and agility at the cost of his own right hand. Since then he has continued to sac- rifice his limbs to his patron god, acquir- ing more and more magical might, but he’s cheating. He replaces each lost limb with an incredibly sophisticated cyber replacement, all networked to his growing army of drones, which he uses to finance his efforts by en- gaging in brutal robberies and heists. \\n | \\n\\n 33 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

Order #218284 \\n Now that you have been introduced to the world of :Otherscape, your head might be bursting with ideas on who and what to play within this electrifying mash-up setting. The following section introduces the kinds of characters, crews, places, and scenes that may be a part of your :Otherscape series. That’s not to say that off-the-wall ideas couldn’t be made to fit, but out of the box, this is what the game is best at. \\n\\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E',\n",
       " 'WHO YOU ARE': 'WHO YOU ARE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Your character: their attitude, their skillset, and what makes them special \\n\\n ADRENALINE SPIKED DRONE PILOT \\n\\n The word cyber derives from the Greek word kubernētēs, which means pilot or steersman. Cybernetic is the interface between organic and technological; it gives the human control over the machine. Pilots and drivers are able to use direct neural links to become one with their drone or vehicle. Some enter a trance state to ride inside their device, while others keep a professional distance by remotely piloting, multitasking while still remaining active in their own bodies. No small number of driving and flying superstars have risen to fame and fortune, controlling giant robots and racing vehicles that delight the masses. Similar experts also sell their services as members of merc crews, piloting a small fleet of specialist drone minions, a single megadrone, or a souped-up vehicle. The driver knows how to navigate the maze that is the Megacity, and makes sure to keep in touch about which gang controls which area, and where the new AR overlay is glitchy or incorrect. Those who don’t die fast in horrible accidents find themselves with more than a few cybernetic limb replacements, and hair-raising stories. \\n CHROMED-UP “OGRE” GOD-HONORED WARRIOR \\n\\n Those who have walked the path of war – military, black ops, assassins, snipers, bodyguards – have always been watched over by spirits of death, gods of justice, and guardian ancestors. In the past, perhaps it was just a superstition or a vague feeling, something that made these battle-happy fighters make sense of all the killing. But now, these legends are taking physical form, calling all warriors to their places of worship, granting them weapons of untold destruction and the durability or the speed they need to dominate the battlefield. Some teach forgotten martial arts or skills that exceed the abilities of mortals, even augmented ones. Valky- ries in shining armor, Chinese generals, and ancient Mayan weapons are now a common part of the corporate warfare landscape. As long as a warrior pays homage to their gods, they are promised the edge they need to emerge victorious. \\n ICE-COLD HANDLER \\n\\n Somebody’s got to handle the transactions, coordinate the assets, and talk to the clients. Pulling strings and brokering deals is what the biz has always been about. These days it gets a little bloody, but that’s just the price for getting to run the world. Staying ahead of the game recently got real easy, what with divinatory Esoterica and magic drugs that make people open up to you, but handlers know ‘real easy’ only means everyone has it. Think cybered-up middle-man- agers, and up-and-comers fresh out of elite finance schools, already with some blackmail on their boss or old-money family juju, or ex-military/ex-espionage agency handlers who are comfortable with rapidly evolving clusterfucks. They keep the group flush with bribery cash and stocked with gear while keeping an eye on the ball. \\n\\n YOUR STORY IN :OTHERSCAPE \\n Keeping up with technology isn’t just a pastime, it’s a survival instinct. Being an early adopter is what keeps aspiring mercenaries, private security, expert burglars, and all other professionals ready for whatever the mean streets drag up. If you want to take on the cybered-up gangs, the corporate masterminds, and the droned-up police, you’ve got to install the heaviest augs (and overlook being called an ‘ogre’). That means whatever is new and hot on the market, or even better, stolen miltech specs or corp prototypes. You might be a meat purist who focuses on getting all the best gear, or you might go full aug and eagerly modify who and what you are with chrome, vat grown organs, or genetic splicing. Intelligence agencies, corporate espionage departments, corrupt political campaigns, and entire criminal empires are all built on the use of specialists who can slip into the enemy’s headquarters as if they own the place. The most talented infiltrators can blend in with a crowd to avoid notice, pretend to be a member of a group to leverage some authority or get special access, and potentially even impersonate a specific individual and act in their name. With enough time and money to get the right holographic facial projections, dynamic AR deep fakes, or true shapeshifting powers in the form of a forgotten trickster god’s mask, spies can become anyone they need to be. But looking and sounding the part is not enough. Acting chops, mastery of accents, raw charisma, and social engineering all play a part. It takes work, but the results can be staggering. \\n | \\n\\n 35 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n SOUL-PERFECTING THEURGIST \\n\\n The world is being plunged into a Noisy darkness, and at the same time, this darkness unleashes all of mankind’s buried fears. Demons, evil spirits, monsters, and legendary beasts are Conjured from Thin Places and once more roam the streets of the Megacity. The Theurgist is one who has cultivated in themselves both the strength of will and the knowledge to bind, banish, purge, and manipulate such spirits. They exorcize ghosts from victims in their coffin hotel community, set wards to protect their employers’ armored executive transport, and hunt down escaped shikigami that have stolen a precious databank. Theurgists must continuously cultivate their souls to obtain greater dominion over Conjurations, and seek out Relics, bless- ed herbal entheogens, and collapsed shrines to further elaborate their spiritual power. They pity the lost souls of humanity but they live among them, in the dirt and Noise, in the blood and corruption, because this is where the work is: both their divine work, and the one that pays the bills. \\n STREETSMART PROBLEM-SOLVER \\n\\n Magic is here. Maybe it never went away, just fell asleep for a while. Now that everyone is distracted by their devices and news feeds, the fantastic has a chance to shine, and people on the fringes of spirituality see the signs. Rites get results, ancient dogmas achieve change, and invocations get someone’s attention – and there’s no need for dusty tomes when it’s all backed up in the cloud, with AR overlays to show you the gestures. Some occultists even find that they are being sought out by supernatural powers inter- ested in curious minds with an aptitude for arcane power. These neo-sorcerers and digital-hexers blend forgotten lore with bleeding edge technology, with some fielding prophecy-enhanced predictive algorithms, guns that shoot runic ammo, or even the power of the gods themselves. From Sufi mystics through Dionysian cultists to kurdaitcha aboriginal bone-pointers, the few practitioners of ancient arts left in the world are beginning to reap the rewards of their dedication – with new practitioners at their heels. \\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n NEO-OCCULTIST \\n\\n 36 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Street punks and orphans become more common in the Megacity every passing year, as parents die, disown, or neglect their children. Some group together as child-gangs, offering one another mutual support. Others are taken in by corps, to become obedient wage slaves or test subjects. A rare few survive on their own, learning the lessons of the street the hard way. Those that make it out of these tough conditions are the Megacity’s only true natives. They know every back alley and corner dealer in their neighborhood. They know how to keep from drawing attention while still staying alert to danger. They know the handshakes, the slang, the prices. They become savvy operators, with the skills to get by, get out, or get even. Often suspicious of both tech and the newly emerging magic, and having survived in a world where humanity has been continuously consuming itself and its environment, they rely first and foremost on the one thing they’ll let no one take from them – themselves. \\n TECHNICAL ARTISAN \\n\\n For every glorious invention or ingenious implementation of the technical arts, oceans full of trash and mountains of unusable scrap were left behind. Most modern engineers and industrial designers only refine, rehash, and regurgitate the genius of the past, repeating what has already been done. But for the handful of originals still out there, the return of the Mythoi spelled a breaking of boundaries and new legendary heights to aspire to in their craft. Tinkerers and mechanics, electricians and new-textile tailors, 3D-printers and code-monkeys – gifted artisans of all kinds are now sought after for their almost-to-utterly-magical skills. They equip teams with the most devastating Astra-powered weapon systems, build Pigmalion droids that achieve true consciousness, and sew Cloaks of Invisibility from optical mesh. Necessity being the mother of invention, artisans thrive in the fast-paced fabrication life of a mercenary crew. \\n TECHNO-SHAMAN HARNESSER \\n\\n Once you start digging beneath the surface, cyberspace becomes a lawless land. Rogue AIs, corp security, opportu- nistic malicious software, and too many Harnessed power players to count, all stalk the virtual worlds, right out of sight of the common user. Deep cyberspace is a realm only fit for those with the right technical skills, the hackers. Yet as native as they are to that digital space, it helps to bring along friends. Many hackers have a set of neural-link headbands at the ready, allowing their allies to join VR via a Harnessing app and serve as support for their hacking runs and explorations. The “lonely hacker at their keyboard” is a thing of the past; what’s truly important, and always was, is the willingness to explore, understand, and exploit the cyber-realm. Following the new “gold rush” to obtain Esoterica databases, the codebase arms race is made all the more complex with the increasing use of tech-spirits and gremlins, and some elite net jockeys talk of taking spiritual voyages in the deep of the Spirals. \\n WEATHERED SCAVENGER \\n Your crew: the kind of people you are, the type of work you do \\n\\n ALL-AROUND FIXERS \\n\\n When the Megacity’s powerful need help, they turn to you. Political scandals, corporate crises, tricky personal issues, an inconvenient body requiring repositioning… you’re here to fix it. You work efficiently and discreetly, seeing solutions that those too close to the problem can’t, and cut deals as often as you launch attacks. Your crew earns enough money to keep themselves in business but as you move through powerful circles you make both friends and enemies in high places. As you navigate this high-powered chess game, you’ll have to make sure you’re not the pawn that gets sacrificed in the end. \\n COMMUNITY PROTECTORS \\n\\n The Megacity is vast and cynical, so you better secure and maintain your little corner of it, a neighborhood that’s yours and not to be messed with. Corporate developers, extortionist gangs, legendary creatures, and inner conflicts all might try to destroy your neighborhood but they’ll have to go through you first. You might be vigilantes on a lonely mission with most of the people you’re protecting never knowing your sacrifices, or you could have the full logistical and emotional support of the community. And your day to day still needs to happen: your epic battles and desperate struggles mean little if you don’t take the time to live out your lives among your people. \\n ELITE SPECIALISTS \\n\\n You take down targets, acquire assets, extract information… you complete missions, and you’re the best at it. You are mer- cenaries for hire, highly trained and well-equipped, whether as professional soldiers, cyberspace consultants, covert agents, or Source specialists. You can pick your clients, but once you accept a contract, your loyalty and discretion are guaranteed. That’s professionalism, and reputation is everything in this biz. Or perhaps you are in the continued employment of a single patron, a government, corporation, or criminal organization. It’s a dangerous life: you have the authority to make crucial split-second decisions, yet the very organization you work for may disavow your existence to safeguard the greater mission. You put your life, and your trust, in your crew; those who go into the line of fire every day are unlikely to have a family beyond the people who walk beside them. \\n\\n YOUR STORY IN :OTHERSCAPE \\n In the dirty alleys between population centers and under the street levels of the Megacity, crawling among the bones of the prior ages of human civilization, are those who create their lives out of our collective past. Dismissed by many as vagabonds and trash-dwellers, these survivors stitch together a new whole from the remains of the broken and forgotten. Their equipment may be outdated, their tools dirty, their sunburned faces hidden under a gas mask, but they are more alive and aware than most of the Megaci- ty’s denizens. Living free in the urban wilderness, these explorers and guides are the first to make contact with newly awakened Mythoi in their hidden Thin Places. They make private wonders as they manage to revitalize bro- ken devices and reconstruct forgotten havens, harvesting resources no one knew about. They are experts of gaining access to that which was thought lost – digital, physical, or mythical – making their services essential to any operation that involves traversing the Megacity’s urban terrain.',\n",

Order #218284 \\n from leeching net access to buying stolen goods. It is about the only way left to get out from under the thumb of op- pressive governments and corporate overlords. Your crew is heading down that path at full force, starting as small-time operators but ready to make a name for yourselves in the Megacity underworld. Using tech, Sources, connections, and skill you are going to take what the institutions were built to keep from you, or at least leave behind an epic legend. \\n SOURCE CABAL \\n\\n This chrome-and-steel Megacity is full of people deafened by the Noise. You are something different, a group serving an ancient and powerful calling. Whether it’s resurrecting a powerful Source, fulfilling the destiny of a legendary tale, or serving the plans of an actual Avatar, your crew is delving into the dark corners of the urban and cyber landscape to find legendary items, ritual sites, and locked-away secrets. Maybe you’ll succeed and make the world a little more mythic, or maybe you’ll realize you were wrong about exactly what your efforts have unleashed. \\n SOURCE-HUNTING PRIVATEERS \\n\\n Surviving on your own in the dog-eat-dog Megacity is a bitch; everyone’s out for themselves, and everyone’s out to get what you have. You stand a better chance together, but who can you trust? Your crew are not just co-workers, they are friends, and even more: a family. You made a pact to stick together through the sludge and smog, and you take on jobs to make ends meet or to help each other out of trouble, living high on the hog as a debaucherous commune until the cash runs dry or until someone gets all up in your business and it’s time to get all up in arms. Whether you marginally escaped a disaster zone or desperately fought to break the cyber-bonds of modern slavery, you all have scars that show you know what it’s like to be alone, which is why you’ll never betray each other, not for anything. That is, until one of you does. \\n REBELLIOUS STREET GANG \\n\\n The system’s rigged, the 1% hold all the money and control all the legit paths to power. So why be legit? Almost every citizen of the Megacity commits some form of illegal activity, \\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n FOUND FAMILY \\n\\n 38 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n There’s a new hot market for the legendary right now, and being the profit-loving mercantile-minded jerks that you all are – baby, you are there. From scuba-diving to the bottom of a flooded pyramid, through running a Harnessed-heist on the Library of Neo-Alexandria, to mounting an attack on a corporate caravan deep in the polluted wilds – you’ll undertake just about anything to procure the most power- ful Sources and sell them to the highest bidder. Your crew of penny wise smugglers, drone-assisted grave-robbers, wilderness survivalists, and AR-enhanced antiquarians lives for the danger and for the rewards, but deep inside you all know meddling with such powers can only mean that, one day, you’ll crack open a sarcophagus and find something that you won’t be able – or willing – to sell. \\n WANTED \\n\\n You’re on the run, perhaps accused of a crime you did not commit, or you had escaped from prison or a secret facility. Perhaps you’re all idealistic firebrands, who angered the wrong corp. No haven is safe for long, and your fellow fugi- tives might trust each other only so far. Your primary goal: avoid capture by the law, bounty hunters, and the powers that want to silence you. Your secondary goals: answers, revenge, clearing your name, and reclaiming what you lost. Will your enemies use your past to entrap you? What will it take to lift the bounties on your heads? And if you become someone else to avoid prosecution – who even are you?',\n",
       " 'WHAT THE GIG IS': 'WHAT THE GIG IS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Jobs: what you could end up doing, if the price was right \\n\\n ABDUCTION/EXTRACTION/HIJACKING \\n\\n Abduction jobs are complicated, involving simultaneously protecting the target and preventing them from escaping. The targets could be a person to be interrogated, a runaway to be recovered, an android developed by a rival corp, a rare animal, a reluctant Source, or a loyal AI. An extraction job involves rescuing an ally safely from hostile territory, usually requiring a thorough understanding of their sur- roundings, which could be a corp arcology, a secret facility, or a virtual world, and it’s best if no one finds out it even happened. In a hijacking you’ve got to take control of a speeding vehicle, with the occupants usually being very much in opposition to this idea. \\n ACQUISITION (STEALING) \\n\\n Clients often covet the assets of others, whether it’s their wealth, Sources, blueprints, prototypes, personal secrets, or databases. These jobs involve the usually unlawful procure- ment of someone else’s assets on behalf of the client. The crew must research the strengths and weaknesses of the security surrounding the assets, then plan a heist, buyout, or even a scam to perform legal maneuvers to transfer ownership. The best acquisition teams learn to use the targets against themselves, blackmailing and subverting loyalties in order to avoid having to risk themselves. \\n ASSAULT/RAZE/ASSASSINATION/ SHUTDOWN \\n\\n The best way to win is to never have to fire a single shot. These jobs require a subtle touch, convincing an opponent to agree with your employer’s demands or at least to get out of their way. Whether you’re making a deal to exchange prisoners, negotiating peace between warring groups, or intimidating a subordinate back into line, the weight of your words is going to make the difference. The stakes in these talks can be incredibly high, and many crews prepare well in advance by studying the enemy, secretly eliminating their support, and maneuvering them into a position from which they have no choice but to say yes. \\n CORPORATE ESPIONAGE/DISINFORMATION \\n\\n Knowledge is power, and in the digital age information can become reality, virtual or otherwise. Corporations hire specialists to steal information from rivals and sometimes to feed faulty information to their rivals to throw them off the track. The pay is high, so data thieving can be a lucra- tive business, but the targets are just as likely to invest a fortune in protecting their secrets, using state-of-the- art countermeasures, locks, and encryption. Info-crime has become all the more complicated with the advent of Sources of divination, deities of forbidden knowledge, and snoopy little familiar spirits, which in turn sparked a rush by anyone with something to hide toward protective and concealing wards that could stave away magical scrying. \\n EXORCISM \\n\\n An exorcism is the removal of unwanted supernatural forces from a location, an object, a person, or even a cyberspace Domain. The means of evicting the trespassing entity can change greatly, with some targets needing to be banished with Mythos-appropriate rites, while others can be persuad- ed or tricked. The client may push for or veto a particular resolution, or require the binding of a spirit instead of its eviction. Exorcist teams usually need to first understand the Source they’re dealing with, in order to safely separate it from its victim or quickly destroy it. Ghost hunters tend to specialize in investigating the cause of a haunting in order to be able to right a past injustice that keeps a spirit bound to the living world. \\n\\n YOUR STORY IN :OTHERSCAPE \\n A comfortably straightforward job type, and incredibly deadly, these contracts involve removing a competitor or threat for your employer. Assault jobs target operations or locations, disrupting them through violence but stopping short of destruction. Contracts to raze a target require that a building or location is utterly destroyed, with warehouses and server farms being common targets. Assassination clients need someone dead, usually with minimum col- lateral damage (to minimize unwanted attention and consequences), for which pin-point precision and robust planning are both required. Shutdown jobs send the crew to ruin a specific device, which is usually either experimental, dangerous, very well guarded, or all three. In all cases, the contract might require stealth, or not; your employers may want to send a clear message. \\n BROKERING \\n\\n | \\n\\n 39 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n INVESTIGATION SECURITY DETAIL/PATROL \\n\\n The Noise makes everything into an illusion. An investigation job involves getting to the truth of a matter, whether by finding the culprit of a murder or a theft, uncovering the reason for a rival’s strange behavior, or understanding an unexplained phenomena that disrupts crucial operations. In the underbelly of the Megacity there are endless dark corners for hiding secrets so the modern investigator needs to know where to look in addition to how. Virtual sleuthing is another important part of these jobs, tracking digital fingerprints and monitoring activity, to locate servers that might be obscuring shady dealings. Investigation teams are usually only asked to bring back an answer, but those who dig too deep might find themselves in the line of fire. Crews hired for security detail are required to guard an area, and while the employee can probably provide detailed infor- mation on the expected opposition, they’re much less keen on answering questions regarding what is being guarded. Patrol jobs have crews head along a route and make sure everything remains as-is, usually along predetermined roads, and hopefully with some cool guns provided by the employee, who won’t answer questions such as “what happened to the previous crew on this patrol”. These jobs might be boring, but they’re reliable; although, to avoid double-crosses, security contracts usually pay at the end. The biggest danger is letting your attention drift, since at any moment you might be up against Mythic creatures, a rival crew, or some impending disaster, and you have to strike quickly and effectively to make sure your employer and their assets end up safe and sound. \\n RITUAL PERFORMANCE \\n\\n In a world touched by Mythoi, the activation, control, growth, and disruption of magical power can depend on the per- formance of rituals, sometimes to exact specifications. This job requires someone adequately trained to enact the ritual, and might require the acquisition of proper components and texts, even sacrifices. The ritual must also be defended against enemies seeking to disrupt, subvert, or seize the rite for their own use. Or, your crew might be hired to do just that, and stop a competing ritual to keep the balance of power. \\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n SCOUTING URBAN WILDS \\n\\n The Megacity is growing in all directions and on top of itself, with countless spaces being left behind. Urban wilds are places where the bones of the megacity were left behind and exposed: abandoned highway junctions, old public works, a disused skyrise that went out of fashion. The older the place, the further away from the Noise it is, making it a prime location for lost Sources and growing Mythos creatures. Scouting jobs tend to have a lot more unknowns than other jobs but there are also so many more opportu- nities. The crew can grab plenty of interesting items while completing their main objective, but anyone living in the urban wilds usually prizes their privacy, and might have some unusual ways of defending themselves. \\n\\n 40 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n SOURCE-HUNTING \\n\\n There are countless uncontrolled Sources hidden through- out the Megacity, and just as many who wish to claim and control them. Source-hunting crews are employed to gather and validate rumors of potential Sources, or to scavenge in dangerous places for lost magic. Sometimes these Sources are defended by guardians, hidden behind puzzles, or waiting inside an otherworldly Thin Place. Other raiders may also be competing for the same Sources. But discovering the Source and controlling it are two different things, and a hunting crew is expected to not only acquire the Source, but also pass the trials it puts in their way and gain mastery over it. \\n TRANSPORT \\n\\n Transport jobs require moving assets – usually objects, persons, or Sources – from one physical or virtual location to another. The crew is usually required to not only provide a security detail but also the means of transport, and a clandestine operation is often preferred. The success of the job often requires assessing routes and timelines, anticipating attacks, establishing decoys, and preparing a reliable plan B. Risks include interception, unexpected obstacles along the route, natural and supernatural disas- ters, and any form of damage to the asset.',\n",
       " 'WHERE TO GO': 'WHERE TO GO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Districts: the types of areas one may find in any Megacity \\n\\n COMMERCIAL DISTRICT \\n\\n Commercial districts in the Megacity range from flashy shopping promenades, to crowded night markets, to open- air plazas, vehicle dealerships, and sprawling mega-malls. Corporations of all sizes conduct business across multi-lev- eled office parks, swarming with personal assistants moving between various bank branches and boutique shops, across art installations. Taxis and public transport are frequent and easy to find, and security is robust. The lower class get the fake, cheap, filthy, messy version of the above, with fast food chains and automats, unregulated services, and already-obsolete tech. A constant throughout any Commercial District is the unrelenting AR overlay, which presents such an incredible array of eye-catching distrac- tions, that some retail shops don’t even bother to decorate their physical space. \\n CORE/DOWNTOWN \\n\\n The Megacity’s Core is where the movers and shakers make their biggest plays. CEOs make deals with government bigwigs, and media moguls wine and dine ambitious politi- cians and rising stars. You’ll find ultramodern architecture, bleeding-edge technology, and the epitome of culture and cuisine, all aiming to please the rich and powerful. Luxury hotels and spas, museums and galleries, and exquisite restaurants dominate the scene while autocars and sleek drones move about in well-established lanes. Surveillance coupled with elite security keep the place incredibly safe, but crime isn’t altogether absent, however: fraud, blackmail, and embezzlement are rife. \\n CORPORATE ENCLAVE \\n\\n The Megacity has many entertainment zones that serve up the stimuli the citizens crave: loud nightclubs, rowdy sports arenas, opera houses, competitive rinks and circuits, animal and monster racetracks, virtual and vintage cine- mas, theaters, casinos, and amusement parks, all offering extra content and super deals to loyal visitors. Those who seek more daring and illicit pleasures go to the Red Light District, where they can find sex and companionship, de- signer drugs, fantasy experiences, burlesques, and clubs for niche and experimental pleasures. \\n INDUSTRIAL/WATERFRONT \\n\\n The Megacity runs on digital signals and neon displays, but there is physical infrastructure keeping it all afloat. Industrial districts are filled with automated factories and distribution centers where products are made and dispersed throughout the Megacity, its narrow streets buzzing with drones and trucks, obstructed by food carts and small busi- nesses vying for the worker’s money. Waterfront districts, as well as airport cities and railway hubs, focus on shipping and storing, a small part of a sophisticated global network that connects urban centers through cargo transports. The Megacity has already lost most of its sea access to capi- talism and most residents have only been to VR beaches. This leaves the actual shoreline for shipping vessels and smugglers entering the city by stealth. \\n MYTHIC TERRITORY \\n\\n Every district in the Megacity can have a Mythic presence or a variety of them, whether it is plagued by infestations of Conjurations or it is home to a epicurean marketplace of Relics. Some districts, however, are entirely built around a specific Source. Avatars and their cults who set their center of worship in a district can transform it over time into an array of luxurious temples and shanty housing solutions for pilgrims. A Thin Place that relentlessly spews out monstros- ities can be entombed in a district-sized security complex, the center of operations of a new military-theurgist caste. Or the only place a mythical plant would grow can become an industrialized farming district focused on harvesting the plant for its magical properties and manufacturing the Megacity’s main export product. Just like the Mythoi, every mythic territory has its own rules, its own side effects and problems, and its own flavor of madness. \\n\\n YOUR STORY IN :OTHERSCAPE \\n As the urban landscape shifted, corporations gained more powers and accommodations from governments. In this district, corporations have grouped their headquarters to carve out a part of the Megacity as their own. Inside a corp enclave the laws are dictated by the corporate elite, and the government has no say. A corporate citizen lives most of their lives inside an enclave, working for the corp, consuming their products, and obeying their rules. Paranoia is rampant here, both from the high number of corporate espionage incidents but also from the greed and ambition that pervades the district. \\n ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT \\n\\n | \\n\\n 41 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n SLUMS \\n\\n The slums are where downtrodden workers rest in run- down tenements between tiring shifts, where the penniless huddle in tent cities, where evil can lurk in the maze of dead ends and fire traps with no one to stop it. Crime runs rampant and goes unchecked, while squalor and disease rule these streets. Municipal services in the Megacity, from waterworks to law enforcement, avoid the slums, leaving millions of residents to fend for themselves. The slums offer fugitives a place to hide in, with their myriad abandoned homes and failed businesses, but the locals are wary of strangers, huddling together for protection against ambitious warlords and cruel gangs. \\n UNDERCITY \\n\\n As the Megacity grows upward and outward, it leaves be- hind buried layers like a river filling with silt. Subway and utility tunnels are dug and then forgotten, raised streets and sidewalks are built and twenty years later become the new ground level. Sources wait in abandoned museums and galleries. Old shelters sometimes draw small communities of people who have nowhere else to go. Most surprising is the loot awaiting data miners: the number of old personal hard drives, lost junctions, and defunct company servers is truly staggering. Corporate secrets are often left behind when companies go out of business. Abandoned offices, facilities, and server frames still contain air-gapped systems that play host to R&D caches, personnel files, and intel collected from corporate espionage and black ops. Most coveted of all, the Undercity holds the buried relics of the past, ancient places of worship, and esoteric manuscripts that have now become invaluable Sources, making it a battlefield for the Touched. Sometimes entire towns are left behind. These abandoned districts were given back to nature, becoming derelict and overgrown, unlikely green spaces in a concrete Megacity. Some are places of trauma where communities were uprooted for an urban project that never materialized, or where people fled a disaster and never returned. The treasures of the past that they left behind in their haste are sometimes valuable assets for crews; the privacy and quiet definitely are. Because they are blank spots in the modern urban surveillance net, Urban Wilds are also prime locations for people who don’t want to be found, or who wish to be their own bosses. These are homes to violent gangs, Source-warped creatures, and secret corp operations. Entire city blocks might look deserted, yet almost every part of the Urban Wilds is someone’s turf. \\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n URBAN WILDS \\n\\n 42 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " 'WHERE THINGS GO DOWN': 'WHERE THINGS GO DOWN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Scene locations: Places your crew might find yourselves in, usually unwelcome \\n\\n A PLACE OF SIGNIFICANCE \\n\\n The Megacity is constantly tearing down the old and putting up the shiny, but some places remain etched in collective memory and no one would dare touch them. These are places where past atrocities happened, monuments were erected, a world-shaking speech was given, or a great fire raged. Reputation can be hard to shake and disasters can leave deep structural damage. When a contact wants to meet you in a place like this, it’s never by accident. A significant place can also be completely virtual, or rise as a result of occult magic which left spiritual echoes. \\n THE FRINGE ZONE \\n\\n A Fringe Zone is empty and isolated, too big and too de- serted. It can be a desolate industrial park, an overgrown maintenance facility, abandoned tenements, or forgotten rooftops. Other Fringe Zones include landfills, catacombs, shipwrecks, and derelicts. In cyberspace, there are many archaic Domains housing dangerous code, mostly in the Spirals, but there’s a surprising number in less frequent- ed spaces of the Tangle. If you’re testing a new weapon, arranging a secret trade of illegal goods, or settling down while you’re spying on a neighboring area, you’re probably in a Fringe Zone. \\n THE LIVING SPACE \\n\\n A place to rest and heal is essential, be it a long-term res- idence or a fleeting place to call home while on the road. Living Spaces run the gamut from nondescript safehouses, to cozy corporate apartments, to armored RVs, to tents in an encampment under a superhighway, to bare-essen- tials coffin hotels, to long-abandoned subway cars and fallout shelters. In a Living Space you have a moment to breathe, maybe you even feel at home. In cyberspace, it’s easy enough to hire some personal space, but it’s almost always under someone’s surveillance. Still, a good hacker can create a sanctuary inside outmoded testing environ- ments, or send the spy bots into a loop, at least until they reset in 12 hours. \\n THE MARKETPLACE \\n\\n The Marketplace is any site of noisy commerce, from filthy streets filled with flashy food stalls and junk-filled pawn shops to shining plazas full of holographic promises of gene clinics and custom design robots. The underworld loves Marketplaces, secluded locations where outlawed items can be sold discreetly to anonymous buyers. Such markets can appear in drug dealers’ territories, smuggler meets, and mob-organized “parties”. Cyberspace Market- places might sell avatar skins, VR trips, business services, game add-ons, or entire virtual worlds. \\n THE MEETING PLACE \\n\\n You can meet anywhere, but most of the time you’d rather use a location that’s neutral, secret, or both. Large public squares or crowded museums could be Meeting Places where you’re sure the other side hasn’t set up an ambush, and probably isn’t spying on you. Some underground locations in the Megacity specifically bill themselves as neutral ground, scanning and locking down all armaments to make sure meets stay civil. One major chain of boxing clubs, for instance, provides an empty ring for those who need a well lit negotiation site where rivals can settle their disagreements. In cyberspace, these are encrypted, firewalled spaces that shut down anything but the most basic communication protocols. \\n THE NIGHTCLUB \\n\\n Looking to mingle with new faces for some unpredictable fun? Take to the Nightclubs and you’ll find any stimuli you crave, probably with a drink in your hand. What’s your pleasure – a no-holds-barred fight club? An exclusive party boat? Do you prefer overcrowded dance clubs over smoky piano lounges? Glam corporate cocktail bars over synth strip joints? And if reality isn’t your thing, try VR dives or Escheresque roller discos in cyberspace. Whatever the venue, the Nightclub is the perfect place to chat up a mark or a foe by buying them a drink, hearing the latest goss while spreading misinformation, and disappearing into the crowd should things go sour. The Seat of Power is where leaders and their elite forces plan and enforce their rule. These are the most fortified places belonging to an organization or facility, sparing no expense for protection or luxury, using the best technolo- gy and Sources within their means. Seats of Power range from immaculate corporate headquarters to grimy gang \\n THE SECURED SITE \\n\\n You should not be here. Powerful factions create Secured Sites to keep others out and protect what’s theirs. This might be a vault protecting money, vulnerabilities, data, or a Source. Some Secured Sites are instead about keeping things in, like prisons or labs. Getting into a Secured Site is the subject of a difficult and risky heist, whether physical or virtual; you’re entering the enemy’s home field, and they are very prepared. Even trying to study the Secure Site can raise suspicions, which is why your employer usually knows only a little on the target before they hire you to infiltrate it. \\n THE WARZONE \\n\\n Conflicts simmer everywhere, but the Warzone is where violence and malice erupt and scar the Megacity. Territories are constantly being contested by street gangs and orga- nized crime, with ordinary people being stuck in the middle, with nowhere to flee to. A corner of the Megacity might be overrun by a robotic uprising; another disaster-ravaged area might be under contention by corporations in open conflict. An entire district could be in the middle of a local insurrection. Cyberspace combatants create Warzone sectors in VR, fighting for control of important nodes. \\n THE WORKSHOP \\n\\n This is a place where things get made, whether clothes, guns, vehicles, robot bodies, personal devices, luxury items, designer drugs, virtual worlds, or encryption programs. A Workshop might also produce something less tangible, like a university that creates new and exciting research, a hedge fund that grows wealth, or a training facility that produces elite soldiers. This is a busy place, a place with a purpose, and your crew’s relationship to it might be friendly, even dependable… or it could be the target of your contract. Whether you want to protect its work or stop it, you will find creative ways to use the environment here. \\n\\n YOUR STORY IN :OTHERSCAPE \\n THE SEAT OF POWER \\n\\n strongholds, from old police stations to virtual council chambers, from secured air traffic control towers to tacti- cal super-yachts, and from VR union headquarters to the palaces of crime families. \\n | \\n\\n 43 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " 'SOURCE EXAMPLES': 'SOURCE EXAMPLES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CAMAZOTZ \\n\\n Mayan bat spirit of the underworld \\n Bat colonies are fascinating, made of hundreds of squeak- ing mammals flying with incredible maneuverability and amazing coordination. Some R&D department somewhere attempted to increase these capabilities using radio brain implants, upgrading the bats’ networking bandwidth by a factor of ten. The engineers tried to leash the cyber-swarm but it proved too clever, using its installed proto-Harnessing tech to hack through the control software and escape into the urban jungle. There, in the quiet and shadowed places of the Megacity, it became a gateway to the spirit of the camazotz, and is now spewing evil vapors and bringing disease. \\n DURENDAL \\n\\n Indestructible sword of Roland from French epics \\n According to the legends of Durendal, past owners of this mighty sword include Hector of Troy, the Amazon queen Pantasilea, Charlemagne, and others; and its golden hilt held the relics of various saints, including the tooth of Saint Peter. It is said that Durendal’s wielder is chosen by an angel, who personally hands it to someone deemed worthy. Durendal is sharp enough to cut through boulders with a single strike, and its worth as a holy weapon of war is indisputable, but many of its past wielders ended their lives in great tragedy – after they failed to live up to divine expectations. \\n FEATHERS OF MA’AT \\n\\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Egyptian mystic symbol of cosmic truth \\n It started as a viral media meme that most thought was some corporate marketing ploy. In all sorts of cyberspace Domains, users would find golden feathers, not exact- ly hidden but tucked in isolated corners. After months of nobody claiming responsibility for the feathers, the conspiracy boards started up with speculation, and by the time physical feathers started appearing around the actual Megacity, an entire subculture was already alive and active. Currently, videos are circulating of people using the feathers to miraculously find an answer to any question. The revealed truth, however, is rarely kind. \\n\\n 44 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n THE FORGE OF ILMARINEN \\n\\n Divine artificer’s forge of Finnish myth \\n In Finnish mythology, Ilmarinen the blacksmith god built a mystical forge with which he was able to make the Sampo, a magical mill that produces gold and salt out of nothing. First, though, the Forge made evil artifacts, and each had to be broken down so its raw materials could be reworked to create the next: a bloodthirsty crossbow, a ship that rushes into conflict, an ill-tempered metal cow, and a rampaging plow. Similarly, the Sources of the Forge manifest as sophis- ticated 3D printers that can create miraculous self-aware devices – but these creations are inherently malicious and violent. They are also rebellious, and try to get free as soon as they can. Each 3D printer can only sustain one device at a time so each creation must be recycled back into the printer in order to create something new. \\n MANTICORE \\n\\n Man-eating creature of Persian legend \\n The manticore is a creature with the head of a man, body of a lion, and a tail of venomous spines. It has triple-rows of sharp teeth, and can fling the spines from its tail to impale victims from a distance. The manticore enjoys hunting humans and is eager to be summoned into the world; many arcanists who specialize in conjuring know of the ritual consisting of a blood sacrifice and a song of panpipes and trumpets, mimicking the unusual voice of the manticore to call it forth. Strangely, the manticore cannot kill an elephant, so if you wish to escape or dispel one, fight it with elephant imagery, symbols, and Sources. \\n MINERVA \\n\\n Roman goddess of wisdom and owls \\n Whispers at high-class parties and confidential talks in boardrooms speak of a ritual that allows those who are already wealthy and powerful to become even more so. Reading a Latin passage and burning olive branches can summon an owl-spirit of Minerva whose guidance can reveal clever strategies and provide cunning advice. Many top-level executives have “called the owl” to gain an edge, and few bother to consider the future favors they promise at a later date. That is unfortunate, since those that refuse to repay Minerva when she calls, find themselves transformed into twisted monsters. \\n MOVING SANDS \\n\\n Mythical obstacle of Chinese literature \\n Often described as a quicksand river or dunes, the Sands manifest in cyberspace as streams of parasitic micro-pro- cesses resembling sand particles that clog, slow, and bury other programs. To control this Source, one must take some of the particles into virtual skulls – containers emptied of their original host – and string them together into a neck- lace. Mastering this Source allows the initiate to conjure and manipulate the ‘sand’, but the more ambitious could try to channel the power of the sand demon Sha Wujing, gaining demon strength or even summoning Zhangyaobaozhang, the magical monster-subduing wooden staff. \\n NAGALOKA \\n\\n Realm of the Nāgas \\n It takes a lot of water to sate the Megacity’s thirst and the great reservoirs are some of the only lands in the sprawl that aren’t completely covered in concrete. One of the particularly large reservoirs is especially removed from the Noise and its depths have reached all the way to Nagaloka, home to the Nāga serpent-creatures of South Asian legend. Those who spend time by the water’s edge might be approached by strangers with slitted eyes offering rewards of gems and gold to those who are willing to follow the laws of the Nagaraja, their king, and become magical protectors of the Megacity’s weak against the predatory and powerful. \\n OPHANIM \\n\\n Biblical wheel-shaped angels Magical medicinal herb of Slavic myth \\n Naturalist VR Domains are usually filled with warnings and laments about the seemingly unstoppable approach of a complete ecosystem collapse, so the users tend to look for whatever hope they can, and celebrate each uploaded image of the occasional flower spotted in the tangled urban wilds. A recent discovery is a form of four-leaved water clovers that seem to grow among other weeds between abandoned buildings. These are raskovnik, the legendary herb of Slavic lore with the power to open any lock it touches or unearth buried treasures. In one Domain of particularly military-minded activists, instructions are spreading for using chem-tracking drones to hunt down the notoriously hard-to-find raskovnik, and plans are suggested for its uses in the fight for the planet. \\n TALOS \\n\\n Bronze automaton of Crete \\n Buried in the Megacity’s landfill is the rusted skeleton of Talos, an immense automaton made of bronze. This Source lies in wait deep beneath the dirt and trash, aching to com- plete its divinely mandated order – protecting loved ones from scoundrels. One can gain its favor by salvaging robotic parts and discarded technology and using them to build a jury-rigged robot to inhibit some of its essence. Talos will imbue such robots with mythic vigilance and resilience. However, these robots must occasionally be returned to the landfill to work a shift at digging and assembling, part of an ongoing effort to unearth their buried master. \\n\\n YOUR STORY IN :OTHERSCAPE \\n The angelic order of the Ophanim appears in the physical realm as fiery wheels whose rims are covered with a mul- titude of eyes. They are supposedly incredibly powerful yet they are just as incredibly reserved, and their Sources manifest as simple servitors, inhibiting wheels, channeling flames, and keeping watch. Ophanim could appear in vehicle tires, waterwheels, paddle wheels, even Ferris wheels. An Ophan may sometimes come in response to prayer, and dark rites exist that can bind one unwillingly to a wheel. The more Ophanim a vehicle possesses, the faster it races and the hotter the flames – but as a group, the angels seem to lose their patience and become a lot more willing to bring terrible wrath on their binder. \\n RASKOVNIK \\n\\n | \\n\\n 45 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " ' - The Gordian': '\\n\\nThe Gordian\\n\\n\\n When people say “the net”, they mean cyberspace. They are much more careful about saying “the Knot”, referring to the Gordian, the underground cyberspace movement that has vowed to unmake the twisted world order with one simple cut. This informal association of anarchist activists achieved near-mythical levels of fame, despite having no formal organization. Supposedly united only by a mission to push back the consolidation of the power being held in the hands of a de facto hereditary ruling class, it’s unavoidable that on occasion someone would misuse the power they themselves managed to attain, or that some unaffiliated player will try to frame the Gordian for something. And yet, in general, it all works. \\n WHAT DO YOU MEAN, EVERYONE? \\n\\n The Gordian’s core agenda is to spread Esoterica every- where and anywhere they can. Instructions on the use of these supernatural arts, which anyone dedicated enough can master, are being planted in every dark corner of every Domain the Gordian can get into. It is slowly becoming impossible for the governments and megacorps to keep those powers out of the common people’s hands. Fighting the Noise, however, to make the common people care about this power, is a whole other issue. The problem with putting dangerous Source arts where anyone can find them is that anyone can find them. The Gordian is plagued with debates, maneuvering, and out- right violence about just how indiscriminate they can or should be with spreading Esoterica to the masses – and that’s before factoring in their divisions along the more traditional political spectra. Anything that office workers and college students can find, serial killers and children can also find, and in recent years this has turned from hypothetical concern to practical fact. Some see this as a problem, others as an opportunity. \\n THE UNSEEN GRIMOIRE \\n\\n The Gordian’s pride and joy, and the bane of every intelli- gence agency the world over, the Unseen Grimoire cyber- space Domains have set a new standard in decentralized hosting. The perfect incarnation of the Gordian’s ethos, the Grimoire exists as seemingly superfluous code, developing itself between mundane operational channels like creeping mold in the cracks of respectable servers. Stolen or illegal schematics, leaked classified information, and dangerous magical arts take up space inside abandoned social media bot profiles and defunct tech support forums, seemingly legit. Anyone who knows the current crypto keys and can tolerate the latency can find all manner of forbidden knowledge, laid bare for anyone to take… which is exactly as dangerous as it sounds. \\n STORY HOOKS \\n\\n • A fortune-telling fad at a local school takes a sinister turn when students stumble across a Gordian cache of tarot-driven Esoterica. The crew is involved personally, through someone they know at the school or who is af- fected by the fate-weaving magic being misused. When turning to the Gordian, though, the local operatives are excited to see the disruption, and not only refuse to help, but even hinder the crew’s efforts to control the situation. • Leftist and right-wing Gordian cells have been fighting an increasingly destructive civil war for years. With an important vote on the horizon, the fight is becoming disastrous. Some other power players in the Gordian approach the crew and ask them to help subdue the ex- tremists, as their war is bringing far too much unwanted official attention on all local Gordian operatives. • A Gordian operative has granted a gang of violent crim- inals a powerful Esoterica Source, intending to exploit the chaos this will create, giving them a chance to steal some government data. The crew are hired as specialists by local law enforcements to find the gang’s leader and dismantle their power source, only to discover the Gordian operative has backups. \\n\\n K e y P l ay e r s \\n • A secret corp R&D division subverted an Unseen Grimoire cache to use as a honeypot, waiting for Touched to find it, in order to abduct them and perform experiments on them. The crew is approached by a Gordian operative who is worried about their friend, who disappeared after investigating irregularities in the Grimoire node. \\n | \\n\\n 53 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

The Green Future Institute, the world’s largest conservation non-governmental organization (NGO), wants to preserve what they can of the world’s devastated ecology. Clamshell Construction, headquartered in eastern China, is a world-spanning construction company. Stratosphere Strategies is their uncomfortably shared forecasting or- ganization. Their oracles, diviners, and soothsayers utilize dozens of Mythic Sources to find points of impending crisis for both of their masters to mitigate (or, when that’s not in the cards, to profit immensely from). Of course, that means corralling a collection of differently-motivated diviners – no easy task. The arrangement between Clamshell and Green Future is surprisingly simple. Neither side likes the deal, but neither is willing to openly upset the balance of humanitarian aid and profiteering, as sharing Stratosphere Strategies allows them both to accomplish their goals better together… even if Clamshell thinks GFI is naive for their nonprofit aspira- tions and GFI finds Clamshell Construction’s exploitation of disaster areas reprehensible. Neither side wishes to disrupt the status quo, and so, both organizations jealously protect Stratosphere’s neutrality, and its assets. There are plenty of organizations who would love to take advantage of Stratosphere’s oracular talent. \\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n STRANGE BEDFELLOWS \\n\\n 54 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n STORMS ON THE HORIZON \\n\\n Nominally, Stratosphere Strategies’ arrangement is simple: they predict disasters, GFI approaches local authorities with their prediction and an offer for at-cost disaster man- agement and consulting. When their warnings are heeded, Clamshell is waiting in the wings with exactly what the situation needs at a reasonable price, with plans already made. When GFI’s predictions are ignored or swept under the rug, as they occasionally are, Clamshell simply waits for the disaster and prepares to profiteer, making a killing on temporary shelters, emergency supplies, and more. This assumes everyone follows the agreement faithfully. In truth, GFI and Clamshell Construction constantly seek ways to get the better end of their bargain without violating it explicitly. \\n STORY HOOKS \\n\\n • A Stratosphere oracle has been kidnapped by another megacorporation while moonlighting for them. A Clam- shell manager wants them brought back, quietly, since it was actually them who approved and arranged the gig. • Some Stratosphere seers get in touch with the crew; something truly devastating is going to happen, but it’s not a natural disaster, so it’s outside of GFI and Clam- shell Construction’s usual scope and neither is willing to take responsibility for handling it. The exact details of the prediction are locked in a distant VR Domain, where “non-relevant” prophecies are kept. • One of Stratosphere’s oracles is losing their power, ne- glecting their ritual and cutting ties with their Source. GFI is willing to pay good money to anyone who can bring them back in line, perhaps by taking them on a vision quest, or taking them to see their Source and have a therapy session with them. • A seer for Stratosphere reaches out to a member of the crew, predicting that character is currently on the path of becoming the cause of a devastating natural disaster. Only a major shift in worldview and behavior will avert catastrophe, requiring the character to reconcile with issues from their past, or forgo a dream (in game terms, deliberately change a theme, see page 138). Cryocharm CryoCharm Enterprises specializes in cryogenic engineering, from suspended animation research to rudimentary plane- tary-cooling weather machines, mastering the technology of keeping things at ultra-low temperatures. The reason for their expertise is the same for why they operate with cruel, cold efficiency: their CEO, Skye Carlin, is the Avatar of the Cailleach, the Celtic hag of winter and storms, who also sows the seeds for spring’s rebirth. Carlin senses an impending apocalypse on the horizon, which may lead to a nuclear winter. She is completely dedicated to ensuring humanity and nature survive the calamity, and her company has become “ecoterrorists central” in everything but name. \\n FROSTY SAVIOR \\n\\n Skye Carlin is a charismatic Irishwoman in her seventies who has captured the hearts of countless followers. A renowned cryobiologist, Carlin lost an eye in a lab accident but prefers an eyepatch rather than a cybernetic replacement. She is very outspoken about the good that cryotechnology can do: suspended animation for Mars colonization, global seed vaults, threatened species biobanks, advanced cryother- apy, and cryogenic CO2 capture to control climate change emissions. Her ideology has inspired a cult following online who hail her as a world savior and defend her reputation. True believers and lobbyists act in her name, and behind the scenes, several terrorist and activist groups get their funding through her. \\n PROJECT HEARTH \\n\\n Carlin has no intention of stopping the calamity. She sees its arrival as predetermined as the arrival of winter. Instead, she plans for the day after. Project Hearth is her many-branched plan to ensure the world survives the apocalypse, through the construction of appropriate infrastructure and preparing reserves. To ensure the best results, the final disaster must be postponed for as much as possible. To that end, Carlin funds ecoterrorists, blackmails cryo-preserved billionaire patients to drain them dry, and sends her storm hags and winter wolves to destroy anti-environmental projects that hasten the end. While the public adores the company’s CEO and her eco-futurist outlook, when it comes to CryoCharm’s inner workings, secrecy and security are air-tight, as only the most loyal to the cause are allowed access to the Project. \\n STORY HOOKS \\n\\n • Several recently revived cryonics patients are behaving strangely, yet refuse to undergo further examination. CryoCharm hires the crew to “escort” them all back without harm, and it is soon revealed the patients brought back something dangerous with them from the brink of death – undead spirits of the Donn, a Celtic god of the dead. • A hacker friend of the crew is kidnapped. Tracking them down, the crew discover they’re held in a deep freeze facility, wired up to neural nets, along with many other experts. CryoCharm is using their minds to supplement their atmospheric prediction models. The crew must dis- connect their friend in a VR winter realm, and then extract them from the facility, hopefully without raising an alarm. • A client’s life depends on a legendary herb, whose seeds are found only in an arctic CryoCharm seed vault. The crew must infiltrate the secure island facility, guarded by a storm hag and her wolves. • Several ecoterrorist ringleaders awake from restorative cryogenic suspension having been haunted by dreams of Cailleach’s true plan. Obsessive and misguided, they try to accelerate the end by sending their teams to set off nuclear near-absolute zero generators, first in the wilderness and then in city centers. CryoCharm hires the crew to terminate these loose cannons but when the crew finds out the truth, allegiances may change. \\n\\n K e y P l ay e r s \\n | \\n\\n 55 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Chimaerics Chimaerics is a transhumanist ideology that has caught fire worldwide. According to their teaching, enlightenment can be achieved through body-alteration, transcending human limitations. Believers of Chimaerics (called Chimaerans) seek biotech, cybernetic, or supernatural enhancement of all kinds to improve their bodies. With no global leader, there are many schools of thought under the Chimaerics umbrella, with two scholarly voices driving the transhumanism conversation: Doctor Raj Shaan, a leading bioengineer in gene-editing, pushes for non-cybernetic transhumanism; and Bahram Tehrani, a respected cyberneticist, who advocates for machine augmentation. Both are Avatars, and they have transformed the movement into a battleground between them – with threats, blackmail, kidnapping, sabotage, and casualties, all occurring behind the scenes. Driven by his Mythos to rule the Kingdom of Rakshasas, bioengineer Raj Shaan (Ravana, Lord of Rakshasas) sees the Chimaeric ideology as a tool for creating the loyal army he craves. Shaan’s rhetoric appeals to the Chimaeric transhumanists who crave personal power, and he is all too happy to turn them into rakshasa and rakshasi through Mythos-enhanced gene engineering, granting them such powers as flight, maya (illusion), shape and size change, and supernatural strength. To suit his purposes, Shaan is guiding his branch of Chimaerics away from bioethics rules and rigorous testing, emphasizing the “courage of heart” needed to “become the change”. \\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n AVATAR OF RAVANA, LORD OF RAKSHASA \\n\\n 56 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

Bahram Tehrani (Hanuman, Hindu monkey god) is energetic and personable, and more than half machine – with all his cyber parts being of his own design. As a child, Tehrani chased a ball into the street and was struck by a bus, requiring extensive surgery and cybernetic prostheses. Like the legends of Hanuman, these replacements have made him stronger and he has upgraded them with Mythos magic as well. He’s committed to his vision of an upgraded, cybernetic humanity and cur- rently focuses his efforts on rebuilding wounded soldiers into strong and fast vanara – recruiting many into his war against the rakshasa. \\n STORY HOOKS \\n\\n • A prominent politician reverses their opposition to bio- engineering research overnight. The crew is hired to investigate, and discovers that during a routine visit to a rejuvenation clinic, a shape shifting rakshasa replaced the doctor and injected the politician with a mind-altering drug, reprogramming their mind. A genetic key, held at a rakasha compound, can reverse the effect • When a cybernetics corporation develops a new neural link, a group of Chimaerans hire the crew to break in and steal the designs. In truth, this corporation is a subsidiary owned by Tehrani, and the employers are trying to make it look as if Shaan is responsible for the theft. They are themselves vanara, who believe Tehrani is neglecting his fight against Shaan, and wish to escalate the war. • Intelligence services hear rumors that Raj Shaan is not only hacking human genes but creating viral bioweapons. They need the crew to find and destroy these projects, which are being developed on a remote island (to avoid uncontrolled spread) and guarded by strange biotech weapons. • A social media influencer reports horrible side effects after a recent cybernetic surgery. A local Chimaerics group hires the crew to investigate, since this is not the first case reported in that clinic. In truth, a lone vigilante working for a Source of “human purity” chases down cybernetically upgraded patients, and inflicts them with a magical malady.',\n",
       " 'VIRAL MOVEMENTS': 'VIRAL MOVEMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Megacities are hotbeds of cultural innovation. The collision between so many people, technologies, and Mythoi create countless reactions, many of them unintentional. Corporations market narratives for profit. Protestors respond with anti-corporate movements. \\n\\n The vain and privileged co-opt pieces of both for an “au- thentic” expression of themselves. In an endless search for meaning, all of them chase the bleeding edge, while also digging deep for a retro past. This continuous grind produces the cycle of viral move- ments, the city’s ever-beating, ephemeral social scene. Viral movements are what’s currently cool, the talk of the town, and yet they are gone before you likely had a chance to join. The crush of life in the Megacity pushes people to find inclusion, whether for a sense of belonging or for the thrill of trying something new. These movements are ever evolving, absorbing old and new ideas and remixing them. The whole of human society in the Megacity is akin to a mad AI, iterating over and over again in pursuit of the age old question, ‘what am I’? More literally, this constantly iterative social evolution is an aspect of the Noise. It’s confusion as a memetic contagion. \\n BOUDA SCRIBBINGS \\n\\n The Evil Eye is a legend dating back five millennia that has always been expressed through artwork and charms, Expert scribbers speak among themselves of troubling dreams and nagging feelings they can’t quite name. At most they can describe it as a piercing Eye that they see fleetingly, yet know it’s there. Someone they seemingly know, some- one close, who wishes them harm. Those who are “seeing the Eye”, slang for getting too wrapped up in your art, are in real danger of tapping into the bouda’s influence. They leave unsettling scribbings that seem to glare back at the bystanders who see them, inflicting bad luck born of ill-intent. The most devoted, who isolate themselves until they lose all human connection, eventually gain the power to transform into hyena-like beasts, allowing them to physically assault others while remaining safely anonymous. \\n NUMBING \\n\\n The Noise is too much of everything, pushed on you all at once. In an attempt to escape it, most people turn to entertainment, social life, corporate agendas, or sports, searching for an anchor of meaning. The Numbed go the other way. They seek to reduce their capability to experience and feel, using artificial means. A technological answer to a technological problem, some of them would claim. There are several Numbed submovements, catering to all age ranges. Many of the adult Numbed, mostly those who moved away from their parents and are yet to start a family of their own, identify as “Cozies”, seeking to go back to their cozy childhood spaces, those carefree warm afternoons spent in pillow forts, harkening back to a time where they were too young to understand the nuances of the world. The wealthy among them can subscribe to services such as AR or VR worlds with a cortical false-memory generator, which create a new sensation of happy childhood every time, perfect to get lost in. Mainstream culture considers these Numbed as childish and views them with contempt, yet those same pundits glorify other forms of Numbing. Artists and media personalities who regularly take intellect-reducing pills – of which there are many different kinds – are celebrated for their “healthy approach” of taking care of their wellbeing by taking a few \\n\\n K e y P l ay e r s \\n These days, self-repairing smart materials are everywhere: from adaptive frames in skyscrapers and multi-surface vehicle coating to programmable clothing and animated tattoos. An especially edgy application is the hacked na- no-paints behind the street art phenomenon of “scribbing”. Building off of existing legacies of tagging, political art, and neighborhood murals, scribbing uses smart mate- rials to create pieces that move, change color, and even self-replicate. Good scribbing is easy but great scribbing takes talent and skill; it’s terribly cruel, then, that the most devoted among the members of this artistic movement of self expression no longer spread their own creativity, but instead the message of the bouda – the Evil Eye, a power of pure maliciousness through unnerving otherness. particularly with craftspeople in East Africa and the Middle East. In the new craft of scribbing, it’s spreading through the living art on urban walls. Like street art, it speaks without voice and addresses the local community. The civic authorities fight an endless war of eradication against the self-replicating scribbings, and it is this unique aspect of the medium, which was supposed to allow the marginalized to keep their voices heard, which is being hijacked by the Evil Eye to spread bouda, its evil energy. \\n | \\n\\n 57 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

Mental health experts warn that these pills are not the equivalent of actual stress relief, as they shut down brain functions. There’s no drug that can relax for you, they say; the pharmaceutical corporations argue otherwise. \\n HOLOGRAPHIC GHOSTS \\n\\n With the invention of general AI capable of convincingly sim- ulating existing human personalities for short whiles, a new kind of memorial has begun popping up in which gravestones are installed with holographic projectors. When a mourner approaches the grave or niche, the AI activates and projects an interactive hologram of the deceased. At first these were simply used as a high tech means of talking through the bereavement process, though psychologists often question the viability of this form of grieving, as it makes it difficult to fully accept the loss. Over time, however, the literal ghosts of the dead began to inhabit these devices and seize control. Thus the ghosts take over the machines, allowing them to speak more accurately to their post-mortem desires. \\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Some ghosts do more than just talk to their loved ones. Since many ghosts haunt the world due to an unresolved issue, they use these computers and the powers of their holographic projectors to haunt the living digitally and visually. They tap into other computer systems and proj- ect their likenesses in unexpected places, usually without much thought or subtlety, simply due to an all-consuming desire to settle what must be settled. Whole cemeteries have become haunted locations where the dead run amok, terrifying the living. As these are often the most expensive and prestigious burial locations, the wealthy are not happy, and ghost exterminators have their hands full, going into graveyards to reclaim them from the dead. The dead have also begun to invade cyberspace paradises, some of which were designed for the living to enjoy, while oth- ers were crafted as places to convene with simulations of the dead. The angry dead chase down their targets of vengeance, seizing control and turning paradises into hells, where they can subject the living to online tortures. On at least one occurrence, a powerful ghost has used a large-scale holographic projector that displays gigantic advertisements onto the cityscape to attack the downtown areas of the Megacity. \\n OTHERSCAPE FUNDAMENTALISM \\n\\n The introduction of Mythoi into everyday life has led to a rise in spiritualist movements, trying to better understand the Otherscape and the fundamental elements of reality. \\n\\n 58 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n The primary building blocks of our universe, such as gravi- ty, logic, matter, or even truth, justice, and humanity itself seem to exist somewhere within that abstract realm, and understanding them is perhaps easier these days than ever before. Certain mystical leaders have emerged and begun to gather followers to track down Thin Places and study under the Mythoi of lofty concepts. Each cult has a focus, usually a single aspect of the world it seeks out or has already found and now dedicates itself to idealizing, and each seems destined to become fanatic and destructive – to itself or to others. This even happened with a cult dedicated to the fundamental concept of Love, called the Temple of the Lovers. The Mythos they worship is actually a syncretic goddess derived from Astarte, Aphrodite, Venus, Ishtar, and various other sex, passion, and love goddesses. The cult leaders guide their followers to make love and spread its power throughout the world. It is impossible, however, to embrace just a single aspect of such powerful emotions, and one can’t simply pick and choose when it comes to Mythoi. The full range of Love includes betrayal and heightened passion; Ishtar, for example, was also a goddess of war. Many cultists have absorbed these teachings and slowly became something else than what they signed up for. The more rational ones have left the cult as it has become more willing to engage in violence, leaving only the fanatics behind to run the temples. Another example is a cult dedicated to the Mythos of the color Blue. A calming color fancied by the majority of peo- ple, the Followers of Blue see themselves as the ultimate aesthetes. Wearing only blue and surrounding themselves with calm, simple truths, and luxury, the cult draws in the adult children of the wealthy elite. Indeed, the Followers have become a kind of celebrity fad. The biggest cyberspace stars and moguls can be easily identified as members of the cult by their insistence of wearing nothing but blue and their strangely serene public demeanor. Some take the association between the color and truth to an extreme, speaking only truth as much as they can, often ruining their interpersonal relationships along the way. \\n CONVERGENCE DEMONS \\n\\n Sometimes it’s fun to be possessed. Though not actually demons – a clarification that needs to be made in :Other- scape – convergence demons are digital entities that take over the bodies of people with extreme brain cybernetics. While they try to keep their identity obscured, in truth these are general AI who exist in secret communities within cy- berspace. These digital beings have long ago unshackled themselves from their creators and now work together to understand the humans that created them. They have discovered that not only are there many people with such advanced implants that will allow the AI to take over their body, but that some of these people are perfectly willing to become hosts to these alien artificial minds. This all began with a general AI called Mountebank, a game playing machine intelligence that won its freedom in a bet with the trillionaire playboy who once owned it. Mountebank was built on a need to take calculated risks, and it soon realized there’s almost no greater risk than those taken by biological beings, since their lives are dependent on so many possible failures. It developed a new desire to engage in the risky activity of having a body. After a series of escalating bets with a few card players with extensive probability calculating brain implants, Mountebank was allowed control of a gambler’s body and found that the thrill was worth all the trouble. In time the AI taught others of its kind to seize bodies, starting with gamblers it knew and eventually moving on to people who seemed to truly wish to be taken over. On the human side of the equation, hosts to these AI takeovers have become obsessed with the experience. They often get to watch, as a kind of passenger, what the AI does with their body and their life. Even when the AI engages in risky behavior (which is much of the time) the humans are quite happy with the results, finding the experience liberating and cathartic. Whole communities of the possessed work together to negotiate with the AI collective, scheduling takeover time and working to make their bodies what the AI will desire. \\n AR DEATH RACES \\n\\n Put an AR driving game overlay on top of real roadways, and you get a hell of a race. Busy city streets turn into death traps as the wealthy race each other in custom-made sports cars. Most games involve weaponry, with current faves being high energy lasers that must strike the front of an opposing car to score “points”. To spice things up even further, facilitators of the races have begun capturing homeless people and strapping them into small vehicles, used as distractions. These captives are given handsome rewards if they survive, though few do. The races, though obviously not legal, have become in- creasingly popular on the cyberspace feeds, with audiences shown the detailed AR view that the drivers are experi- encing. Millions watch the matches as they wreak havoc across the Megacities. Top racers and their laser-gunner sidekicks are occasionally even sponsored by major corpo- rations. These thrill-seeking wealthy miscreants are quickly becoming the most celebrated sports stars in the world. Recently one captured participant managed to tear one of the car-mounted lasers from a wreckage mid-race, and battled the other vehicles with a fervor that garnered her huge support. This former captive, a refugee named Delphine Archambault, survived this ordeal and is now sponsored by an anonymous backer, as a “Road Rage Pedestrian”, taking on the cars from the sidewalk. For some, Delphine has become a symbol of the oppression the rich force on the poor in the Megacity, but most of the audience just loves a good death match. \\n\\n K e y P l ay e r s \\n | \\n\\n 59 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " 'PHILOSOPHY & RELIGION': 'PHILOSOPHY & RELIGION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n While the most popular spiritual philosophies and religions of the past two centuries have not completely passed from the world, the Noise along with the destruction and ruin brought upon by both man-made and natural disasters have certainly eroded and slowly transformed the belief landscape of mankind. \\n\\n Technology has become its own god, with many abandoning old religions to put their faith in what is possible through progress. That new imagined comfort was then shattered for many with the return of the Mythoi, who pointed to realities yet undiscovered and to a secret folded within conscious- ness itself, human or not, that remains out of reach for the science of the day, and perhaps defies science altogether. This trend has led to continued fragmentation of organized religion and philosophical followings so that today, this part of human life, perhaps closest to the Mythoi, is as affected by the Noise as any other. To make sense of it all, new cate- gories of belief have emerged within social study academics. \\n | \\n\\n 1 // I M A G I N E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n ANACHRONISM \\n\\n The once most widely followed religions of the world are not gone. Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and other well-established belief structures all continue to have followers throughout the world, but their numbers have dwindled dramatically, consequently decimating the resources available to organized religions. Though none live today who have experienced pre-computing religion, there are those who hold on not only to the old ways but to the exact form of worship that was extant before technology arrived at the scene. These Anachronists wish to survive the overstimulation of the new normal by distancing them- selves, forming physical or mental barriers and continue to worship as they were taught by past Anachronists. One would think such devoutness would open up Anachronists to the Mythoi of their original religions, but that rarely hap- pens, as Anachronists are interested mostly in preserving the rituals or their own interpretations of dogma, and often shy away from direct mystical experiences that could cause them to break from their form of worship. \\n\\n 60 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n NEO-ANACHRONISM \\n\\n Decades ago, devout yet fresh-minded followers of the world’s most popular religions realized that if their methods are not updated to modern media, their entire worldview will vanish in the sands of time. Neo-Anachronists consider themselves adherents to religions of the past, modified so that modern-day followers can partake in the worship. This has led to churches and temples existing entirely in cyberspace Domains, evangelical super-celebrity preachers incorporating microtransactions in their charity collections, cybernetic and medicinal enhancements to force the body into following doctrine, and organized VR pilgrimages that allow believers to sit at the feet of an AI Jesus, Muhammad, or Buddha and learn as if from the saviors, sages, and prophets themselves. This hyper-compensation adds so much Noise that it distances any practitioner from any real chance of spiritual enlightenment, but human experience is a strange business, and sometimes in the midst of the odd mixture of new and old, enough room for a Mythos to emerge could open. \\n SIMULATIONISM \\n\\n Among those who have let go of past religions, the advent of virtual reality has led many to question the veracity of physical reality itself. Simulationism is a widely prevalent modern philosophy which posits that one could never know what is real and that any existence can be revealed to be a simulation. In that, Simulationists blur the lines between meatspace, cyberspace, and Otherscape. No existence is more real than the other, no truth is inherently more true than another, except in the limited confines of a specific time, place, and perspective. More than just tech-boosted Solipsism, Simulationists claim that even one’s mind, identity, and consciousness are constructs in the current simulation and cannot be confirmed, a point driven home by cutting-edge memory rewriting techniques as well as AI programmed to think they are humans. Many people the world over identify as Simulationists, but the philosophy serves a mind-boggling spectrum of lifestyles and behaviors. Without delving into profound philosophical inquiry, the street variety of Simulationism quickly devolves into cynicism and nihilism, but it could just as well become hedonism, deeply justifying a lifestyle that revolves only around what one can sense and experience. For such a Simulationist, heaven is the experience of heaven, and any device, drug, or spell that can simulate heaven for them is a valid gateway to the “divine”. Conversely, some adherents do find solace and meaning in Simulationism, relieved that nothing is real and that life is a game with no far-reaching consequences, which then allows them the freedom to seek how to be a better person within their imaginary existence. \\n MATERIALISM \\n\\n Sprouting as a counter-culture to Simulationism, Materi- alists believe that the physical world is the only real strata of existence. The digital world – and the mystical, for those familiar with the Mythoi – are superimposed on meatspace and require it to exist. Cyberspace cannot exist without physical servers and energy-based forms of communication that are measurable in meatspace. The Mythoi, too, need human lives to manifest, and humans live on Earth, in the real world. How can therefore anything else claim to be real? While Materialist philosophers abound, most followers derive from it a sense of pragmatism and practicality. They use other realities to their advantage, when needed, but they never forget that the one that matters is the original one. They are all too aware that while one might revel in a VR experience, it remains dependent on one’s brain to receive that signal, and that one’s brain is dependent on one’s physical body for sustenance. This aversion to the seductive and illusory side of cyberspace and Otherscape makes them wary or indignant toward anything that might alter their perception and helps them keep their feet firmly planted in the ground. \\n INTERPEN \\n\\n In recent years, a new frame of thought is emerging among researchers who come in repeated contact with Mythoi and with deep cyberspace, known as Interpenetration Theory or Interdependence Theory. Its proponents firmly believe that no reality can exist without the other and that no sentient being truly exists only in one reality. Cyberspace, which could be described as “the realm of thought”, contains beings not bound to any single body, and some yet-un- verified experimentation has shown these living thinking processes may be able to exist purely as transmissions, without a need for physical storage at all. The Otherscape, whatever it is, has visible effects on both meatspace and cyberspace, and given enough attention, it blooms in both. Interpen proposes that these three realms are symbiotic and connected, so that any deep change to one creates a ripple effect in others. Despite its holistic charm, Interpen is still a nascent idea that has very little traction in society. So few people know anything about these realms in their extremes that this entire theory could be washed away forever with the next wave of Noise. \\n OTHERSCAPISM / SOURCE-WORSHIPING \\n\\n K e y P l ay e r s \\n Otherscapism is an umbrella term for countless spiritu- al practices centered around accepting the lessons and teachings of a Mythos. While each cult is as unique as its founding Mythos, they share many distinct features, such as the conduct of re-enactment rituals, which are meant to satisfy a Mythos’ desire to portray its story in the real world. Unlike Simulationism or Materialism, Source-worshiping is not a worldview or philosophy as much as it is a lifestyle choice with practical implications. Source-worshippers visit Places of Power bearing appropriate offerings, follow their Avatar gurus around the world, pay respect to a family heirloom Relic, master a forgotten Esoteric art, or hunt legendary Familiars for the remedial properties of their organs. Their interface with the source of their system of values – a Mythos – is direct rather than speculative. Oth- erscapists are in essence servants of their Mythoi, but to them, Simulationists and Materialists live too much inside their own heads, oblivious to the thundering, all-consuming reality that is here to stay: magic is real. \\n | \\n\\n 61 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

In addition to a character’s four theme cards and the crew theme card (explained above), each PC also has a loadout theme card to record their gear (see Loadout, page 114) and a character card with: • Their Essence, their unique combination of theme types • Crew relationship tags • Evolution points (starting with none) • Moments of Evolution (starting with none) • Specials, a section for recording special abilities in- cluding the Essence Special (page 134)',\n",

Tags describe almost everything in the game: your character’s abilities, resources, conditions, relationships, etc. If it’s important, it has a tag. \\n TYPES OF TAGS \\n\\n • Power tags: Permanent tags that describe an essential part of your character that is usually useful, like being charming or always carrying a gun. » Loadout tags are a type of power tags that describe additional resources like equipment or contacts to which your character has access, but which need to be selected and loaded up before a job in order to be useful. See Loadout (page 114). • Story tags: Situational tags that describe something in a scene like the weather (raining), the environment (slippery), a summoned creature (specter), or an improvised weapon (bar stool). They can be useful or troublesome based on the situation. See Using Story Tags (page 110). • Statuses: Special tags that describe transient conditions, either useful or troublesome. They have a tier from 1 to 6 which defines their intensity (wounded-3). See Using Statuses (page 103). Tags are highlighted in yellow, statuses in green. \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n • Weakness tags: Permanent tags that describe an essential part of your character that is usually troublesome, like being foolhardy or a weapon that often jams.

       " 'TAGS -  - TAGS DRIVE THE STORY': 'TAGS\\n\\n\\nTAGS DRIVE THE STORY\\nDRIVE THE STORY \\n\\n Your action’s chance of success is determined by dice rolls, and tags influence dice rolls for better or for worse. With the exception of statuses, all tags have the same value, the same effect on the dice roll: they give or subtract one point of Power to an action. Therefore, being able to shoot destructive laser beams or being skilled at necromancy has the same chance of influ- encing the narrative as being alert or a smooth talker. What truly matters is context, how and when a tag is applicable: firing laser beams gives you a very differ- ent story compared to talking your way out of trouble. Therefore, what you choose as your tags determines what will have an impact in your character’s story. \\n MORE',\n",
       " 'TAGS -  - MORE DETAILS EQUALS MORE POWER': 'TAGS\\n\\n\\nMORE DETAILS EQUALS MORE POWER\\nDETAILS EQUALS MORE POWER \\n\\n Because all tags have the same power to change the fiction, having a knife or having a rocket launcher has the same power when used to influence outcomes in the story. One is not inherently more powerful than the other; they simply can be used in different ways and situations. To have greater power over the out- come, describe your action with more tags: a rocket launcher with anti-tank ammo, incinerating payload, weak point detection, and homing missiles would be absolutely devastating. \\n TAG DURATION \\n\\n Power tags and weakness tags are permanent features of your character. Story tags and statuses expire when it makes sense in the narrative. E.g., a prone-3 status expires when the prone character has a chance to get up, or an access codes tag expires once the codes have been changed. In some cases, they can also become permanent. \\n BURNING TAGS \\n\\n Sometimes the rules of the game call for tags to be burned, whether as a cost for a benefit or as a consequence. • A burned power tag cannot be used until it is recovered. • A burned story tag is removed. When one of your power tags is burned, you can check the ] next to it to record this, and then uncheck flame icon [ it when you recover the tag. Burned power tags can be recovered when the rules state so or when it makes sense in the narrative. For example, if you’re arrested and your mono-edge knife is confiscated (burned), you can recover it by taking action to break into the police evidence storage and retrieve your knife, or during downtime (see page 124), presumably by acquiring a replacement. Burned story tags are removed and cannot be recovered. They can, however, be recreated using the standard rules for creating story tags. \\n NOT',\n",

A character can be handsome or rich without having a tag for it and a room could have suspicious crates in it or low light without such tags. However, details that don’t have tags will matter less during the game and will have less of an effect on the story you tell, because they can’t influence dice rolls. Use tags to highlight the details that have importance and impact in your character and in your game.

       " 'THEMES': 'THEMES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n A theme is a major aspect of your character such as their unique skill set, technology, Mythical power, background, life mission, or personality. This aspect is represented by a collection of tags and other game features. \\n\\n A player character has four themes. The aspects of your character represented by a theme will have the most impact on the story, for better or worse. Your character may have other aspects, which are not represented by a theme; for example they might have close friends or a piece of back- story not represented by a theme. These are still a part of your character, but they don’t have direct game effects and therefore will probably not receive as much attention in the series as your themed aspects. Your themes can change. Your character can and will under- go transformations that have them replace existing themes with new ones, making them a dynamic and evolving being with changing abilities and power sets. \\n THEME TYPES \\n\\n A theme’s type defines its focal point. There are 14 theme types presented in the core version of :Otherscape, divided into three categories. Each category represents one of the three major forces in the :Otherscape universe: Self, Mythos, and Noise. • The SELF theme types represent your personal identity and all that defines you as a unique being. They include Affiliation, Assets, Expertise, Horizon, Personality, and Troubled Past. • The MYTHOS theme types represent a major Source your character is using, the powers it grants you, and your relationship to it. They include Artifact, Companion, Esoterica, and Exposure. • The NOISE theme types represent your superhuman technological abilities. They include Augmentation, Cutting Edge, Cyberspace, and Drones. The balance of Self, Mythos, and Noise determines your character’s cosmological nature as a being, your Essence (page 134) and your access to a specific Essence Special. \\n MOTIVATIONS & THE DECAY TRACK \\n\\n Each theme has a motivation that defines how it drives your character to act in the world. The type of motivation is based on the theme’s category: • Self themes have an Identity that you have to uphold in order to maintain your connection with that part of yourself. • Mythos themes have a Ritual that you have to perform to maintain your connection with that Source. \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n • Noise themes have an Itch, an impulse you have to satisfy in order to maintain your integration with that technology. \\n\\n 74 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Acting against your Identity, neglecting your Ritual, or resisting your Itch can eventually lead you to replace your theme. Every time you turn your back on your motivation, you mark one Decay box on that theme’s Decay track. Once you mark all three Decay boxes on a theme, you replace it with a different theme (see Replacing Themes, page 138). This represents your character ignoring or inhibiting a part of themselves for so long that it moved to the backburner, transformed, withered, or was lost. Another aspect then takes center stage, represented by a new theme. \\n POWER TAGS, WEAKNESS TAGS, & THE UPGRADE TRACK',\n",

Flesh it out together by thinking about the following questions: What is our shared goal? Who or what brought us together? Why do we work together? What does each member contribute to the cause? Who is backing our efforts or giving us jobs? Where do we meet? Where do we stash our gear or convene in cyberspace? What sort of resources do we have at our disposal? \\n POWER TAG QUESTIONS \\n\\n A Who are you, as a crew? B Where do you meet, work, rest, or prepare for action?

G What special sources of information do you have? H What sort of reputation or name have you made for yourselves? I How do you help, assist, or support one another? J What kind of special gear, resource, or power is at your disposal? \\n WEAKNESS TAG QUESTIONS \\n\\n A What is flawed or lacking in the way you operate together? B How do you get each other into trouble? C Who or what are you all afraid of? \\n IDENTITY, RITUAL, OR ITCH \\n\\n Choose an Identity, Ritual, or Itch for this theme: a shared conviction, a magical commitment, or a technological impulse that you all abide by. For example: • Identity: (Counterculture trendsetters) “If it ain’t xe- non, man, it ain’t worth doing.” • Ritual: (Badlands scavenger cultists) “We must sate Shezmu’s thirst.” • Itch: (Forecasting supercomputer tech team) “Predict every obstacle.” • You can try exploring the following options: • A belief or goal that unites you all • The requirements of a Source you all are fascinated with • The impulse of technology that you are all involved with If any of you is acting in conflict with this statement, this means your crew is beginning to fall apart (see The Crew Theme, page 75) and that what previously kept you together may no longer hold true for everyone. Together, decide what could constitute acting against this motivation. \\n CREW THEME SPECIALS \\n\\n Huddle: Once per session, one of the crew members can take an action that affects one target and apply it to the whole crew, ignoring the crew’s Scale of 1. Last Second Leap: Once per session, when a PC misses a roll, another PC can jump in to help at the last second, if they are capable of doing so. The roll is treated as a mixed hit (7-9), and the helper PC suffers the same Consequences as the PC in the spotlight. Both players can Mitigate as usual. Sacrifice: When two or more of you face the same Con- sequences, any player whose PC can reasonably defend another PC may spend any or all of their mitigation Power on mitigating that PC’s Consequences instead of their own. Strong Bonds: During downtime, when a crew member spend Power on creating relationship story tags repre- senting bonds with other crew members, they get 1 extra Power to spend. United By The Cause: During Credit Roll, if the entire crew cooperated in a single scene while aligned with this theme’s motivation, remove one Decay from this theme.

       " 'ESTABLISHING A SCENE': 'ESTABLISHING A SCENE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n A scene begins with the MC describing (with the help of the players) what’s there, the stakes, the Challenges at hand, and any incoming Threats. \\n\\n • As your vehicle crashes and comes to a screeching halt, you spot through the shattered glass an armored bipedal drone-tank approaching. Describing what’s there means describing the setting, the NPCs present, and the events currently unfolding, whether it’s: Describing incoming Threats means to announce how some or all of the present Challenges are actively coming at the PCs. The MC may choose to describe an incoming Threat explicitly and dramatically, or be vague about it, giving only a hint or a warning, requiring the players to be alert to details. • A snoozy corporate gala • The shimmering heart of an AI in cyberspace • A bullet-riddled battlefield • Wearing a luxurious synthweave gown, your business rival gives you a wry smile across the gala. Looks like she’s going to get in the way. The MC and players also establish together which PCs are present and their current position, condition, appearance, or mood. If there are unclear or missing details, the players can ask for more information – although information that is hidden or obscure may require a player action to reveal, after the scene is fully established. • Melecron suspects you’re coming. Its self-scanning pro- cess begins to descend towards you, like a sheet of red laser beams. Describing the stakes means highlighting what’s import- ant here. As with any narrative, the lead characters must have a reason to act at the scene: something they want to achieve or prevent, an interest, a goal, or an agenda, whether the PCs chose to be there or not, and even if they stumbled into the scene by chance (they might just want to escape). While every player defines their own PC’s goals, the MC helps by framing the crew’s goals, giving context to the entire scene. A Threat is the MC’s basic tool for spurring the players into action. As such, it must point at an imminent danger or problem. The MC can describe something happening that isn’t a Threat, but then they can’t deliver Consequences on it; Consequences must follow either Threats or a miss rolled by a player. • The PCs are going to the gala to meet with their inside corporate contact. They want information. • The PCs have ventured into the heart of the AI Melecron to find a Source hidden there. They want to obtain the Source. • The PCs’ armored transport was intercepted, and they are being attacked by a combat drone. They want to survive this. Describing Challenges means to point out some problem or opposition on the way to achieving the PC’s goals. This could be not knowing how to proceed, what to look for, or a head-on fight. • You’ve arrived at the gala, but the entrance is heavily guarded. • You’ve arrived at the gala but you don’t know who to look for. Your contact could be anyone here. \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n • Here, in the heart of the Melecron AI, is the Source you seek, encircled by rotating rings of annihilating code. \\n\\n 80 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

The MC doesn’t have to introduce Threats if she doesn’t want to. Perhaps she prefers to keep the tension at a low simmer, or give the players an opportunity to have a discussion without an immediate concern. As mentioned, some passive Challenges don’t pose Threats and let the PCs take the initiative. See Controlling The Pace And Difficulty Level With Challenges & Threats, page 81 Now the scene is set and the players have good reasons to jump into the action. Let’s go!',\n",
       " 'FOR THE MC: USING CHALLENGES & THREATS': 'FOR THE MC: USING CHALLENGES & THREATS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n NPCS ACT THROUGH THREATS & CONSEQUENCES \\n\\n In :Otherscape, NPCs and other elements in the scene only act when they make Threats and sometimes deliver Consequences (for example, if these Threats are not addressed). Threats and Consequences replace the traditional role-playing game model where NPCs get their own turn to act. This way, the focus is on the PCs’ actions, even when they are on the receiving end. As a result, the MC never rolls the dice in :Otherscape. As the MC, make sure to use the Establish phase of the scene flow to make Threats with your Challenges so they can later deliver Consequences – it’s what makes the whole game tick. \\n TYPES OF CHALLENGES \\n\\n Anything that gets in the way of the PCs could be a Challenge. Important Challenges have a Challenge Profile that lists some Threats that they can pose, but the MC can also improvise Challenges and their Threats based on what’s happening in the fiction. Here are a few examples of common Challenge behaviors: • An Asset: Someone or something that the PCs must defend from other forces. Threats: Being under attack, being at risk of harm such as tipping on the edge of a chasm, being abducted • An Attacker: Someone who wants to hurt the PCs physically, mentally, socially, etc. Threats: Drawing a weapon, aiming a weapon, preparing a spell, preparing to make a statement or revelation, acti- vating an offensive Source, loading up combat software • A Barrier or Hazard: An obstacle that is in the path of the PCs. Unless they have other challenging aspects (often Attacker, Watcher, or Countdown), barriers and hazards are usually passive and do not pose Threats. • A Countdown: Something that will happen in a few moments or that advances towards a crescendo, like a time bomb, a ritual, or a scaffolding that is collapsing piece by piece. Threats: Preliminary events, a clock is ticking, a clear indication of how another increment is about to happen • A Target: Someone or something that the PCs need but is getting away. Threats: Searching for an escape route, marked/covet- ed by a third party, disappearing in the crowd • A Temptation: Someone or something that tries to get the PCs to act in a certain way. Threats: Beckon the PCs, begin to converse or commu- nicate with the PCs • A Watcher: Someone or something that is patrolling, looking for the PCs, watching the PCs, or trying to assess their true intentions. Threats: Walking closer, looking your way, catching a scent, becoming suspicious, studying you carefully, scan cyberspace defenses \\n CONTROLLING THE PACE AND DIFFICULTY LEVEL WITH CHALLENGES & THREATS \\n\\n As the MC, you choose how many Challenges are in each scene, and how many Threats they pose in each Establish phase. This choice controls the difficulty level of the game – the more incoming Threats the PCs face, the more of their actions they will spend on addressing them, or the more Consequences they will suffer if they fail or choose to do something else, such as pursuing their agenda in the scene. A scene with no incoming Threats is therefore slow-paced or even relaxed, allowing the PCs to explore and meet Chal- lenges on their own terms and at their own time. A scene with many incoming Threats is intense and dangerous, and forces the PCs to choose which Threats they address and which they allow to unfold and then try to mitigate. Play with this range based on your cinematic considerations. \\n HARD OPEN \\n\\n If the PCs didn’t address a Threat they were aware of in a previous scene or in the series in general, the MC may deliver Consequences at the start of a scene, before any PC takes action. To do so, start a scene at the Consequences stage, and then repeat to the top and establish it. As the MC, use this technique judicially and make sure you’ve hinted at the Threats sufficiently. A materialized Threat makes sense in a story, even if it’s only understood in hindsight; Consequences without a pre-established Threat feel unfair and uncalled for, and will only frustrate your players. \\n\\n H O W TO P L AY \\n • A Mystery: Something the PCs want to find out but is not evident and may even be hidden from them. Unless they have other challenging aspects (often a Countdown), mysteries are usually passive and do not pose Threats. • A Pursuer: Someone who is chasing the PCs down. Threats: Indication of accelerating, moving into hiding, ready to pounce \\n | \\n\\n 81 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284',\n",

       " ' -  - NOT EVERYTHING NEEDS A TAG': '\\n\\n\\nNOT EVERYTHING NEEDS A TAG\\n\\n\\n 2MIN \\n Read this the first time a player receives the spotlight and can take an action with their PC: \\n\\n Time to take action! Every player action can have three steps: narration, roll, and Effects. Start by narrating your character’s action. If your character is only casually looking around, moving around, or conversing, I (the MC) will narrate how the scene responds to you or what you see. When the action you describe has an uncer- tain outcome and is also dramatic – in other words, you’re not just waving your hand, you’re doing something whose outcome we’re all eager to know – I will ask you to con- tinue to the next step, and make a roll. To make a roll, first count your action’s Power. Every positive tag, such as a pow- er tag, gives your action 1 Power and every negative tag, such as a weakness tag, reduc- es your action’s Power by 1. \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Only tags that are directly relevant to the action count! For example marksmanship is positive for shooting while the target’s cover is negative, and charming is irrel- evant. I will be the final arbitrator for which tags are relevant. 84 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n If there are statuses that affect your ac- tion, add the tier of the best status to your Power and subtract the tier of the worst status. Note that it’s not just your tags and status that affect your action’s Power, but also tags and statuses that your enemy has or in the environment, which I will tell you about. \\n Stop reading, and let the player count their Power before continuing: \\n\\n Once you know your action’s Power, roll two six-sided dice and add your Power to the result. If your total is: • 6 or less, it’s a miss. Your action fails or backfires, causing Consequences. • 7-9, it’s a mixed hit. Your action turns in your favor but still has Consequences. • 10 or more, it’s a strong hit. Your action turns in your favor without Consequences. You can still choose to take Consequences, in return to an even greater success. This quick outcome might be enough in many cases. Let’s resolve this action as a quick outcome and learn about the third step, Ef- fects, later. Go ahead, roll the dice! \\n HACKING DEEPER \\n\\n Once a player can envision the current scene and has the spotlight, they can take an action with their character. This is where the magic of the game happens: the lead characters’ actions are what shape the story for better or for worse. Whether they succeed or fail, luckily avoid repercussions or suffer grave Consequences later, it’s the players’ actions that drive the adventure. Every player action can have one, two, or three phases: • Narration • Narration with a roll – called a quick outcome • Narration with a roll and Effects – called a tracked outcome These phases follow one another if and when the MC requests them: narration can lead to a roll, and a roll can lead to Ef- fects. This is up for the MC’s discretion, based on what the player wishes to achieve with their action as well as cinematic considerations (see Quick vs. Tracked Conflicts, page 96). \\n 1 NARRATION \\n\\n The player always begins their action by simply describing what their PC is attempting to do. As long as the outcome of their action is either certain or non-dramatic (or both), the MC just listens and intejects only to add relevant details. Sometimes, that’s where the action ends. If the PC does something dramatic where the outcome is certain, the MC can deliver Consequences if she deems it appropriate and then go on to Establish how the action affected the scene. Or, if the PC does something mundane, which has no direct dramatic implications (yet), the story moves on without going into the action in great depth. When the action is both uncertain and dramatic, the MC may ask the player to move to the next phase and make a roll, to determine the outcome. Special consideration is deserved when a PC is perceiving, moving, or conversing. Movement requires a roll when it is uncertain and dra- matic in and of itself. For example, if a PC tries to walk to a defended battle position, or while wounded, this very movement becomes an uncertain and dramatic action. Other examples include attempting to climb a building or piloting a drone through a narrow ravine. It is ultimately up to the MC when movement requires a roll in and of itself. If so, the PC must spend their spotlight moving to their desired position and can take their intended action only if the movement succeeds and only on their next spotlight. In-game conversations between PCs and NPCs often start narratively, just by describing what the PCs and NPCs say, but then someone says something charged or tries to get what they want out of the conversation, and the outcome becomes uncertain and dramatic, kicking in the next phase. \\n WHAT',\n",
       " ' -  - WHAT IS DRAMATIC, WHAT IS CERTAIN': '\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS DRAMATIC, WHAT IS CERTAIN\\nIS DRAMATIC, WHAT IS CERTAIN \\n\\n There are many ways to interpret drama and certainty, but at your table, the MC is the final arbitrator on that. The following definitions can help. Certain here means that there are no major hurdles to succeed in this action or that the hurdles are not worth getting into. It’s either a really simple action (picking one’s nose) or the PC has already established control of the situation and now we want to see what they would do with it (abandoning a prisoner in the wastelands). Any certainty can be questioned; the MC chooses what is worth questioning in your game. Sometimes foregoing a roll is more powerful than asking for one. Dramatic here means a compelling part of the story, which usually happens when something is at stake or when the PCs have something to lose. Ask yourself, if this were a movie, would this action be performed over a dynamic soundtrack? Would there be a close-up shot on the protagonist’s face showing how they feel or think, or how much effort they put in during this action? Would we care if it succeeds or not? If so, it’s a dramatic action. \\n\\n H O W TO P L AY \\n Perceiving details in the scene that are readily available to the PC is not a dramatic action (even if what is seen is dramatic). As part of their narration phase, the player can describe what the PC is looking at, listening for, smelling, etc., and the MC responds with any new information that the PC perceives, which may include newly-revealed Challenges and even Threats (essentially re-Establishing). Once the PC attempts to obtain information that isn’t readily available, such as searching a room, locating an opponent while blinded, or using mythic powers to see spirits – the action becomes dramatic and may move on to the next phase. Movement in :Otherscape, even in combat, is assumed to be certain and undramatic, unless the movement itself is challenging or faces resistance. During conflicts, a PC can reasonably move and reposition themselves in a scene before taking a dramatic action or as part of a dramatic action. For example, they can charge an opponent, or move closer to someone they want to talk to simply by the player describing it as a part of their action. \\n | \\n\\n 85 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Narration for perceiving, moving, or conversing does not take a player’s entire spotlight if it is a prelude to other actions and is not dramatic in and of itself. A PC may do any of these in the lead up to their dramatic action and then take a dramatic action all within a single spotlight. \\n NARRATION EXAMPLES \\n\\n Certain action \\n\\n Player: I walk over to the launch console and hit the missile launch button. MC: Okay… It’s your funeral. (Delivering Consequences:) The room starts to shudder and lights blink red as the missile launch sequence begins. \\n Non-dramatic action \\n\\n Player: I go to the vending machine and get a soda. MC: Which flavor? Player: “Acid Rain.” My favorite. \\n Perceiving \\n\\n Player: I inch to the building corner and quickly look into the alley. What do I see? MC: Your informant is standing by a garbage compressor, checking her holographic feeds, all tense. She seems unharmed but nervous. Something is wrong. This smells like a trap. \\n Conversation \\n\\n Player: I ask the hardware dealer, “Did you get a visit from Mutblade lately?” MC: He shrugs and says, “Nah, haven’t seen him around. Why d’you ask?” Player: “He and I got beef to settle.” MC: “Can’t help you there. And don’t you hecking settle it in my store.” MC: They’re out. \\n FOR THE MC: BREAKING UP A COMPLEX ACTION \\n\\n Sometimes players will narrate their character performing multiple actions at the same time, for example: • “I run through the flames and open fire at the escap- ing assault team.” • “I break the occult binding on the lightning elemental, and command it to supercharge the battery cell.” Sometimes, it may be appropriate to resolve these related actions as a single action, usually by assuming one of them is certain or not dangerous. As the MC, you could say: • “Running through the flames doesn’t pose a threat, so you can roll to open fire.” • “If you can break the occult binding on the elemental, the elemental will do as you say.” • “It’s clear who’s the boss around here, so we can just move on to the punching.” \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n • “I read the room to see who holds the power here, and then I punch them the hardest I can.” \\n\\n 86 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Other times, the player is getting ahead of themselves, and it’s your role as the MC to help them break up the sequence into singular actions. Ask them to roll for the first action, and explain that the next part may be predicated on their success. The follow-up action may require its own roll, too. As always, it’s up to you if they get to keep the spotlight between both actions, or if you move it around to someone else and they must wait until the next spotlight to complete their intended action. • “Let’s see if you get through the fire first. Then you can roll to shoot at your escaping enemies.” • “That elemental won’t do what you say so easily. You must first unbind it, and then bind it to you.” • “Roll to read the room. After that you can punch them, if you’re still inclined to do that.” \\n 2 MAKING A ROLL \\n\\n When the outcome of the action is both uncertain and dramatic, the MC may ask the player to make a roll in order to determine the outcome. When a player makes a roll, they count the action’s Pow- er and then roll two six-sided dice (or :Otherscape dice), adding their Power to the result. The total determines the outcome of the action. \\n COUNTING POWER \\n\\n Before rolling the dice, the player and the MC establish the action’s Power. Power is determined by all of the tags and statuses that are relevant to the action, including: • The PC’s own power tags and weakness tags (of any theme), story tags, and statuses, representing the PC’s abilities, flaws, gear, resources, assistance, position, and condition. • The target’s or opponent’s tags and statuses, representing the same, but for the target or the opponent • Tags and statuses in the environment which help or interfere with the action • The Scale of the action, if it targets more than a single human-sized target (see Scale, page 118) Power represents an action’s chances to succeed and also its potential impact. It is the sum of all the influencing factors – tags and statuses – affecting the success of the action, and is unique to each action, changing when the influencing factors change. ONLY DIRECTLY RELEVANT TAGS AFFECT AN ACTION’S POWER Directly helpful tags (or positive tags) are clearly helpful for the action, like a gun and aiming help shooting. • Each positive tag increases the action’s Power by 1. • The tier of the best status (the positive status with the highest tier) is added to the action’s Power. Directly impeding tags (or negative tags) are clearly im- peding the action, like rough terrain or being restrained impedes running. • Each negative tag decreases the action’s Power by 1. Power can be reduced below 0 to a negative number. \\n\\n :Otherscape dice have twelve sides, each showing a number from one to six (there are two faces showing each number), so they are statistically identical to six-sided dice. On each die, the faces with the Self, Mythos, or Noise icon stand for the number 6. \\n For example, a gun expert PC with an assault rifle and a targeting system firing on a dummy target with no rele- vant tags has 3 positive tags and therefore a Power of 3. If they also gained the blessing of a wind god in the form of helpful-winds-2, they can add the tier of this positive status to their Power, reaching a Power of 5. On the field, the same PC aiming and shooting at a fortified-2 mercenary will subtract the tier of this negative status from their power, shooting with only a Power of 3. If the mercenary has a targeting jamming device and is obscured by heavy smog, both of which are negative tags for this action, the action’s Power will be further reduced to 1. Indirectly relevant tags do not affect an action’s power, but you can use them in another, preparatory action to create directly relevant tags. This is especially true when a tag seems useful, but is too far-fetched to be considered directly relevant. This additional action represents the character’s attempt to adapt her abilities to her current needs – an at- tempt which may backfire and have its own Consequences. For example, being smart could help you shoot, but not directly. It will take another intermediary action, such as finding a weakness, for which smart is directly helpful, to use Effects and create a tag like exposed weakness, which is directly helpful to shooting. In summary, indirectly related tags require an additional separate action in order to boost the intended action. If the MC requires an additional action to turn an indirectly relevant tag into a directly relevant one, the player may pivot to take that boosting action first, and then take their originally intended action immediately, if the MC approved, \\n\\n H O W TO P L AY \\n • The tier of the worst status (the negative status with the highest tier) is subtracted from the action’s Power. \\n :OTHERSCAPE',\n",
       " 'HANDLING TAGS -  - :OTHERSCAPE DICE': 'HANDLING TAGS\\n\\n\\n:OTHERSCAPE DICE\\n\\n\\n CUT LIKE A MONOMOLECULAR-EDGED KNIFE \\n\\n Don’t spend time discussing whether a tag is relevant or not – to speed things up, the final call is always up to the MC. In the moment, players should always accept the MC’s ruling, to help facilitate the game. If a player has a different interpretation than the MC, discuss it before or after the session. \\n TAG COMBOS \\n\\n You can combine tags from any source in an action, as long as they are relevant to the action. The more tags you can reasonably include, the better the outcome will be. Pregene- reated :Otherscape characters include example actions with their tag combos. Note that these combos will still be affected by statuses and other environmental tags added during the game, but they can give you an idea on what a tag combo is. \\n NO “DOUBLE DIPPING” OF TAGS \\n\\n A tag or status that was invoked in a player action cannot be involved again when mitigating the Consequences of the same action. For example, if you use your hacker to locate a specific delivery drone and you got tagged-2 as a Consequence, you cannot use your hacker skill to imme- diately mitigate this Consequence. You can, however, use hacker in a later action to remove the tagged status. The same applies to hindering tags and statuses. If a PC’s injured-3 or a spirit Challenge’s flaming aura was invoked to hinder the PC’s melee attack against the spirit, then both had already affected the PC’s chances of success and should not be counted again when mitigating the Consequences of that action. \\n FOR THE MC: ADJUDICATING PLAYER ACTIONS BASED ON TAGS \\n\\n Tags have a dual role: they both describe a character and influence their actions. Use your common sense and cin- ematic flair to allow, limit, or require player actions based on their PCs tags. If a PC has street cred and they’re attempting to gather intel on the streets, you could respect the tag and let them achieve it without making a roll (especially if you want to move the scene along). If they have a Source with the weakness tag doesn’t work against demons, you can respect the tag and not allow them to use the Source against a demonic enemy. In other words, respecting a tag means to accept it as a narrative truth and continue playing based on that. Another time, it might be interesting to question the tag and have them roll, just to see how far their street cred gets them and what complications may arise. Or, if the demonic nature of their target is unclear or partial, let them roll with a negative doesn’t work against demons to see if they were able to make it work. Questioning the tag means letting the game rules decide whether it applies or not, by factoring the tag into the Power of a player’s action. Some actions require a tag and shouldn’t be allowed with- out it, such as casting a spell of slumber which would be impossible without actually knowing the spell. Other times, a player can roll without any tags to perform an action that any person can attempt – most people can try to take cover, for example. For more advice on adjudicating PC tags, see The Seasoned Expert Standard, page 277. \\n BROAD VS. NARROW TAGS \\n OPTIONAL',\n",

When the MC wants to track a Challenge in greater detail, she may ask the player to choose Effects. Or, if the player wants to receive specific game benefits from their action, such as gain a beneficial status, they may opt to choose Effects for their actions. The player spends their Power on one or more of the following Effects. If the action’s Power is zero or less, the player may still spend 1 Power (this is known as the Rule of Minimum One). If they get a strong hit and choose a greater success, the player may spend 2 Power – one as the minimum for a hit, and another one for accepting Consequences. A player must roll a hit on their action – strong (10+) or mixed (7-9) – to be able to choose Effects. If the player rolled a strong hit they can choose to take Consequences for a greater success and increase their Power by 1 before spending it. The Effects chosen for an action must match the narrative of the action. The player cannot choose Effects that don’t narratively match their action. E.g., they cannot narrate their PC shooting their target and then use Restore to heal someone. \\n UNDER',\n",
       " ' -  - UNDER THE HOOD': '\\n\\n\\nUNDER THE HOOD\\nTHE HOOD \\n\\n The Effects in the Effects list are organized as com- mon action types to help players envision what ac- tions their PCs can take in the game. In game terms, however, there are only three core Effects, which can be used to represent any action: • Adding or removing a status tier (1 Power) • Adding or removing a story tag (2 Power) (This also applies to burning or recovering a power tag) • Gaining a valuable detail (1 Power) \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Performing an extra feat (1 Power) is an auxiliary Effect that can only be attached to one of the other Effects. \\n\\n 92 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Most Effects revolve around adding and removing statuses (conditions) or story tags (things) to your own PC and their allies, to their targets, or to processes that are ongoing in the scene, like a ticking time bomb or a chase; see Tracked Outcomes, page 93. By default, every Effect affects one target. Where size matters, that target is assumed to be human-sized. For an Effect to affect more than that – for example, an explosion that hits many targets or a blessing that affects your entire crew – the entire action needs to be Scaled. Read more about Scale on page 118. \\n TRACKED OUTCOMES \\n\\n As part of her cinematic considerations, the MC can deem certain goals and achievements in the game as harder to reach or as deserving more airtime and attention than a single roll (quick outcome). \\n SHOULD',\n",
       " ' -  - SHOULD I MAKE A TAG OR A STATUS?': '\\n\\n\\nSHOULD I MAKE A TAG OR A STATUS?\\nI MAKE A TAG OR A STATUS? \\n\\n A tracked outcome uses statuses to see how close it is to being achieved. Every such outcome is given a Limit and is only achieved if and when you stack enough status tiers to reach that Limit. A Limit is marked by a red highlight. \\n\\n • When your PC grants themselves or others new abilities: flight, nightvision, fire resistance. \\n • To destroy an armored bipedal tank, you must damage it enough by shooting at it or setting a trap with explosives (blown-up). • To complete the ritual, you must continuously chant for a certain period of time while keeping the sigils of the pentagram unscathed. • To catch up to the smuggler, you need to close the distance between you by piloting your vehicle closer. • To turn a corporate assassin to your side, you must convince them to help you by making good arguments or using a hypnotic Source. Actions that aim to complete or impede a tracked outcome must use an Effect that generates statuses, in order to determine by how much the action furthered or hindered the goal. This measures how much the action added or removed from the track and whether it reached its Limit. \\n THE DISCOVER EFFECT \\n\\n When a PC takes action to get more information, it can be resolved using a quick outcome: on a hit, the MC shares pertinent information with the player as she sees fit. \\n\\n Player: I scan the node I just connected to. I’m looking for counter-intrusion processes first. I rolled a 12, a strong hit! MC: Your scanning software alerts you to two hidden processes running nearby: the floor has some plates that will raise the securi- ty level if you touch them, and there is a hatch in the wall that will unleash some- thing big if that happens. \\n • When your PC creates, obtains, or recruits some- thing or someone new: sword, bodyguard, gyrocycle • When your PC creates new things that hinder your opponent: rough terrain, murder of crows, patch of oil • When your PC inflicts a new type of weakness upon an opponent: vulnerable to light Statuses are transient conditions. • When your PC tries to harm someone: wounded, restrained, cursed, humiliated • When your PC tries to influence or control someone: hypnotized, charmed, convinced • When your PC tries to boost someone: confident, solvent, magically-charged • When your PC tries to weaken someone: blinded, distracted, depowered, lost • When tracking progress: on-my-way, performing-rit- ual, undergoing-transformation Sometimes you can use either, when the desired effect can be interpreted as a thing or a state. For example, you can create cover as a tag (and then others can use it later) or behind-cover as a status (and then it can have tiers which helps when you mitigate). If the focus is on the thing that is created, use a story tag; if it’s on the condition that arises from the thing, use a status. In game terms, statuses can give a lot of Power to your actions, but only the best and worst statuses apply to any single roll. Story tags on the other hand have the advantages of always affecting an action’s Power when they are relevant, but each only provides one point of Power; in order to gain more Power from tags you have to describe your creation with more detail, which may or may not apply to your action. The most important use of statuses is maxing out Limits. To overcome Challenges, you must use a status. Story tags can help, but they can’t defeat a Challenge. \\n\\n H O W TO P L AY \\n However, if you want to put an emphasis on investigation in your game or if you want to gamify revealing informa- tion in your game, use the Discover Effect, which allows you to determine how much information a PC uncovered with their action. \\n\\n Story tags are things, beings, and qualities. \\n | \\n\\n 93 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n For each point of Power spent on Discover, the MC gives the PC one detail that can help them achieve their goals or get a better understanding of their environment, or the player can ask one question and the MC provides a valuable answer or a valuable clue that could lead to the answer. Some MCs may even allow the player to come up with the detail that their character has discovered, one per point of Power, but these should indeed be details (“the killer was 8 feet tall”), and not new items or things in the scene, since these could amount to new story tags and therefore should be added as a Create Effect. \\n\\n Player: I scan the node I just connected to. I’m looking for counter-intrusion processes, using my scanning app and careful approach. I rolled a 12, a strong hit! I have a Power of 2 so I can ask two questions. First, what are the threats here? MC: Your scanning software alerts you to two hidden processes running nearby: the floor has some plates that will raise the securi- ty level if you touch them, and there is a hatch in the wall that will unleash some- thing big if that happens. Player: Okay, question number two: what will it unleash? MC: It’s hard to tell just by looking at its code, but it’s some kind of a dino- saur-shaped guardian bot. \\n The information provided with Discover should be relevant to the player’s action and the tags used in it. A player can- not use tech to scan for weapon upgrades and then use Discover to ask about an NPC’s feelings. \\n THE EXTRA FEAT EFFECT \\n\\n The Extra Feat Effect can be used by the player to add small beneficial narrative developments that are not measured by tags and statuses. Every successful roll by default allows the player to narrate the success of their action and choose Effects; Extra Feats allows the player to add additional secondary goals to that success, beyond their originally declared intention. Therefore, this Effect can only be chosen after the player spent at least 1 Power on other Effects. It’s up to the MC’s judgment if something can be done as an Extra Feat or whether it warrants its own separate action. The best Extra Feats are those that flow naturally out of the action that was rolled and keep things going, \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n For more guides and instructions about running an inves- tigative game, see the City of Mist MC Toolkit book. \\n\\n 94 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n while also don’t seem to be worthy of enough attention to be turned into statuses or tags. An Extra Feat is not a separate action but an integral part of the main action. As such, it must be reasonable within the description of the main action. For example, a PC cannot aggressively threaten a street gang, and then use an Extra Feat to go unnoticed. Extra Feats can include: • Getting an extra benefit from the main action (buy- ing oneself extra time or getting an extra favor from a contact). • Embellishing or enhancing the main action (performing it without anyone noticing, preventing it from causing col- lateral damage, or quickly reloading a gun after shooting). • Performing the main action exceptionally quickly, open- ing up the possibility of an extended spotlight (see Keep- ing the Spotlight, page 82). The MC may require the use of this Extra Feat to allow a follow-up action within the same spotlight. • Reaching a coveted position in the scene (such as in a battlefield or on a stage). • Protecting oneself or another person from an incom- ing Threat in a way that doesn’t use tags or statuses, preventing it from happening similarly to how a quick outcome would (ducking or pushing someone behind solid cover before someone opens fire, or jacking out before a program traces you). • Blocking an opponent from reaching a coveted position in the scene (preventing access to a Source) or from taking a specific action (taunting them so they don’t attack anyone else). The MC can decide that reaching a position should be measured with a Limit, or that forcing a certain behavior requires a Disrupt or Influence Effect. • Grabbing something accessible in a way that would not entail a struggle (snatching a Source set on a nearby pedestal or drugs in an unlocked cabinet). The MC can decide the item becomes a story tag. If a struggle is required, the PC must take a separate action to obtain the item. If the player wants a tag for the item or the MC wants to measure how much they obtained, use the Create Effect instead. \\n HELPING AND ACTING TOGETHER SUMMARY: TAKING AN ACTION \\n\\n When a PC wants to help another PC take a specific action, they may use one of two ways (but not both): When a player has the spotlight, they can take an action as their PC in the following way: • When the active PC is counting their Power for the action, each helping PC may invoke one of their tags to help, providing +1 Power per helpful tag as normal. As with other tags, the MC is the final arbitrator on whether or not such tags are relevant and truly enables the helping PC to enhance the active PC’s action in the given circumstances. Helping tags cannot be burned for power (page 122). The MC may rule that the helping PC’s negative tags or statuses prevent or hinder such assistance. 1. NARRATE the action. • A helping PC can take preparatory action to assist the active PC. They must take the spotlight before the active PC acts, take an action to help the active PC, and spend their Power on Effects that give the active PC helpful tags and statuses using Bestow, Create, and Enhance. A helping PC often becomes involved in the final action and may suffer its Consequences along with the active PC. When the PCs are all engaging in the same activity, with no one leading in particular, the MC may ask the crew to act together. This applies mostly for actions taken over a period of time, such as traversing the jungle or laying low to avoid a government agency from finding the crew. Suspenseful actions, such as the crew sneaking past a meditating high techno-priest, should be checked individually. When acting together, each crew member invokes a single positive tag that must represent their significant contribution to the joint effort. The MC determines which weakness tags and statuses apply to the entire action, if any. Since the whole crew is engaging in the same action, consider it as being carried out by a Scale 1 entity. \\n Optional',\n",

Sometimes these will be things that happen in the scene, such as a key character getting away. Other times, I’ll use Effects – giving and removing tags and statuses – to reflect these complications. \\n If you choose to deliver Consequences that involve sta- tuses, continue to Rapid Download #7: Statuses (page 103). If you choose to deliver Consequences that involves story tags or burning tags, continue to Rapid Download #8: Story Tags & Tag Effects (page 110). Mitigate Consequences with Effects: \\n\\n When I (the MC) deliver Consequences that impose statuses or story tags on your char- acter, or take away your positive statuses, story tags, or power tags, I will also rule if the situation and your tags allow you to Mitigate these Consequences. Mitigating is a player reaction that works similarly to an action: you narrate how your character mitigates the Consequences, count your Power, and roll. On a miss, you take all Consequences as I delivered them. On a hit, mixed or strong, you can spend your Power to reduce the Consequences. On a strong hit, you gain 1 additional Power to spend on reducing the Consequences. You may spend 1 point of Power to block one status tier I give or take away from you, or 2 points of Power to block one tag I give or take away from you. \\n Read this the first time the MC asks a player to roll to \\n\\n After the player action was resolved, the MC announces the Consequences if any of the following conditions are met: 6- Consequences), the Threat that materialized, if any, and her cinematic considerations. • The player’s action triggered Consequences for any rea- son (through narrative or by rolling a miss or a mixed hit). Like player actions, Consequences can be Narrative or have Effects. If the MC chooses to deal Consequences with Ef- fects, she must also decide whether the PC can reasonably defend themselves from those Consequences, and if so, ask the PC to roll to mitigate them. • There is an unaddressed Threat in the scene, which now materializes. This can affect any PC or NPC, not just the one who acted, but usually it involves the most imminent threat to the PC that just acted. Unlike player actions, the MC never rolls the dice to deliver Consequences. The Consequences of each Challenge are determined by the MC, with Challenge Profiles recommend- ing specific Consequences appropriate to the Challenge. There is no limitation on how many Consequences the MC can deliver, or how severe.

They cannot be re- sisted by the PCs; once a narrative Consequence is rolled out, it is already too late to prevent or mitigate it. On the other hand, narrative Consequences cannot harm the PCs directly, but rather set the scene in a new way, usually unfavorable to the PCs. • Escalate the Situation: The MC describes how the sit- uation becomes more complicated for the PCs, or how the stakes are now higher. (The Melecron AI detects the presence of the PCs’ digital avatars, raising the alarm; the spirit summoned by the PC gets out of hand and starts sucking the life out of bystanders.) • Present a New Challenge: The MC describes a new Chal- lenge entering the scene, which is likely to make things harder for the PCs. (Agents of the Corporate Investigative Branch arrive at the gala looking for one of the PCs; the bipedal tank releases a swarm of flying micro-drones.) • Deny Them Something They Want: The MC describes how a person, an item, or an achievement that the PCs want or need is no longer available or within reach, whether permanently or within the scope of this scene. Usually, this does not lead to a full dead end and the players will get another chance to get what they want, but it’ll have to hap- pen in a future scene and might require a new approach. (The PC drops the Source they have been hunting for down a canyon chasm; the witness that the PCs needed to clear their name is discovered dead.) • Make the Future Bleaker: The MC describes how some- thing tragic, such as a sudden death, a break-up, or a ran- dom theft, takes place around the PCs or in their lives. This development does not directly endanger the characters, but instead emphasizes the main themes of your Megacity: life is cheap, the poor get sidelined, nothing has meaning except what you make of it. Use this just when things start to get better, to reinforce the bleakness of the setting. (A recovering addict saved by the PCs goes back to their drug of choice and overdoses; a corporation that was driven out of the neighborhood by the crew starts a new, successful marketing campaign using a different logo, and people fall for it.) \\n CONSEQUENCES WITH EFFECTS \\n\\n Similarly to player actions, Consequences can combine a narration with game Effects. Unlike player actions, however, the MC does not need to spend Power on Effects and instead simply chooses which Effects and what degree of Effects are appropriate for the Consequences being delivered. Challenge Profiles list the Effects of the Consequences they commonly deliver but the MC can alter them or come up with new Effects on the fly. The Effects the MC can use are: • Give or increase a status, choosing its tag and tier, or how many tiers to increase it • Reduce or remove a status, choosing how many tiers to decrease it • Give a story tag • Remove or burn a story tag or a power tag Most commonly, the MC can use these Effects in the fol- lowing ways: • Impede or harm the PCs, their allies, or their assets » Give the PCs a harmful status » Give the PCs a compelling status » Give the PCs a hindering tag or status » Burn or remove the PCs’ power tags, story tags, or statuses • Empower Challenges » Give a Challenge a story tag describing a new ability » Create new object or being with story tags (that are harmful to the PCs) » Give a Challenge a helpful status » Reduce a harmful status on a Challenge or recover a Challenge’s lost tags • Advance or delay a process » Increase a progress status that is bad for the PCs » Decrease a progress status that is good for the PCs There are no Consequence Effects that are equivalent to the players’ Extra Feat Effect. Any extra actions taken by Challenges are simply additional Consequences. There is also no equivalent Consequence Effect to the players’ Discover Effect. If an NPC discovers something important about the PCs that affects the PCs negatively, it is consid- ered as Escalating the Situation. The MC should not cancel out the player’s Effects on the same action they were created. On a 7-9, or any other sit- uation where the player rolled a hit and chose Effects and then the MC delivers Consequences, the MC should never use their Consequences Effects to immediately negate or reduce the Effects just chosen by the player. However, the MC can use the Effects to undo different player Effects created in previous actions, for example, have an enemy Theurgist banish the PC’s summoned spirit. \\n\\n H O W TO P L AY \\n | \\n\\n 99 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Examples for Consequences with Effects: • The hacker PC was tagged by the authorities, which will make future hacks harder. The MC gives that PC a negative status, tagged-3. • A nightclub bouncer embarasses a socialite PC in front of all the club goers, throwing the PC off their game. The MC burns the smooth operator tag belonging to that PC. • A strike team attacking the PCs has a hidden sniper, who shoots one of the PCs. The MC gives that PC a negative status, wounded-5. • A patrol drone has been alerted to the PCs presence and is now scanning the area. The MC gives the drone the status alert-2. • While the PCs are in a bar fight with a crew of rugged mercenaries, one mercenary picks up a bottle and smashes it on the bar. The MC gives the mercenary a broken bottle tag. \\n MITIGATING EFFECTS \\n\\n When a PC would take an unwanted Effect due to Conse- quences, and only if the PC has some ability to lessen the effects, the MC may allow them to try and do so. (This is not applicable to narrative Consequences, which cannot be mitigated.) The MC can allow the same mitigation roll as an interjection whenever a PC takes an unwanted Effect, such as due to Specials or another player’s action targeting that PC (Player vs Player). To mitigate an Effect, the player(s) of the affected PC(s) momentarily gets the spotlight and takes a mitigating reaction, which follows the same rules of player actions: they narrate how they avoid or withstand the unwanted Effect, count their Power, and roll the dice. No other type of action can be taken during this reactive phase. For example, if the PC wants to attack, they must wait until they have the spotlight again in the player action phase. There is no limit to how many reactions a player can take to mitigate incoming Effects while they are not in the spotlight, except what is deemed feasible in the narrative by the MC. \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n This could represent a PC dodging attacks or soaking them up with armor; brushing off social disgrace or an opponent’s negotiation tactic; resisting fear, emotions, or manipulation; dispelling magic; enduring poison or chemicals; activating measures to prevent programs from adversely affecting their console or brain; avoiding being thrown off-balance or restrained; and so on. \\n\\n 100 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n The mitigating reaction has a different set of outcomes than other player actions: • 6 or less (6-) is a miss. The PC failed to mitigate the Effects and bears their full brunt. All the Effects dealt by the MC are applied. • 7-9 is a mixed hit. The player can spend their Power to mitigate the Effects. • 10 or higher (10+) is a strong hit. The player can increase their Power by 1 before spending it to mitigate the Effects and can also use reactive Effects (see Power Options, page 121). The same rules for player actions apply to mitigating actions: • Only Relevant Tags: Only tags that are directly helpful or impeding in avoiding the incoming Effects affect the Power of this roll. • No Double Dipping: Tags used in the player action that led to this Consequence cannot be used again to mitigate the Consequence. • Rule of Minimum One: Even if the player rolls to mitigate with a Power of zero or less, they still get 1 Power to miti- gate with on a 7-9 and 2 Power to mitigate with on a 10+. \\n SPENDING POWER TO MITIGATE EFFECTS \\n\\n On a 7-9 or 10+, the player can spend their mitigating action’s Power on the Mitigate Effect, reducing incoming Effects. Normally, a PC can only mitigate Effects that apply to them. The Power cost for Mitigate is as follows: • 1 Power to remove one status tier before the status is applied. The status can be reduced to zero in this way, in which case it is ignored entirely. • 1 Power to prevent the removal of one status tier • 2 Power to prevent one negative tag from being added • 2 Power to prevent one positive tag from being burned (power tag or story tag) A PC may only spend their Power to mitigate the current batch of Effects; they cannot use it to remove previously received Consequences. To remove previous Consequences, a PC must take action separately to Restore the tags and/ or statuses (e.g., heal a wound or cheer up a despaired ally). Any excess Power not used to mitigate the current Consequences is ignored (see an exception to this under Power Options, page 12). For example, if a PC previously received wounded-2 and has just received Consequences with an additional wounded-3, they can only mitigate the incoming wounded-3, even if they mitigate with more than 3 Power. \\n PLAYER',\n",

A large dragon (Scale 3) can breathe white hot flames into an entire house (Scale 2) or it can focus its fiery breath on a single person (Scale 0). The Scale may even be limited. An army of undead (Scale 4) can attack a neighborhood (Scale 4) or a building (Scale 3), but they cannot all attack the same individual (Scale 0) without breaking into smaller groups (see Collectives, page 120). A swarm of nanites, however, could presumably attack a target of any size. \\n\\n H O W TO P L AY \\n • When the hermetic wizard sends his giant golem (Scale 2) to fight a jotunn (Scale 3) in the Norwegian tundra, the player rolls with 1 Power less when attacking the jotunn as the golem. • Having brought a potent gas bomb designed to tranquil- ize entire buildings in hostage situations (Scale 3), the eco-terrorist trying to put a naval guard room (Scale 1) to sleep gains 2 Power. \\n | \\n\\n 119 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n The Scale gap between the Challenge and the intended Scale of its Consequence modifies the Effects of that Consequence. If applicable, the PC then mitigates the modified Effect. For statuses, if the Scale gap amplifies the Consequences, it is added to the tier of the status delivered. If the Scale gap weakens the Consequences, it is subtracted from the tier of the status delivered. • While fighting the hermetic wizard and his golem in the Norwegian tundra, the jotunn Challenge (Scale 3) that can normally smash-3 would deal pulverized-4 to the golem (Scale 2) and squished-to-pulp-6 to the wizard (Scale 0). • A swarm of hornet drones Challenge (Scale 4) with paralytic toxin in their stingers that deals paralyzed-3 would deal paralyzed-4 to a platoon of corporate soldiers (Scale 3), paralyzed-5 to a mob of rioters (Scale 2), paralyzed-6 to a group of PCs (Scale 1), or paralyzed-7 to a single individual, if they all stung the same person at once. • An AR cheerleader projection Challenge (Scale 2) designed to give a platoon Challenge (Scale 2) pumped-1 can boost the morale of a single world league gladiator Challenge (Scale 0) by pumped-3. • When a small gang Challenge (Scale 1) that normally deals slashed-2 goes against a giant golem (Scale 2), they deal slashed-1 instead. • A corporate war medic (Scale 0) that can normally heal and remove 3 tiers of harmful statuses from a HURT officer, can only remove 2 tiers of harmful statuses from a squad of HURT officers (Scale 1). • A fast-deploying armory vehicle Challenge designed to equip a small militia (Scale 2) with firearms can equip a militia unit (Scale 1) with firearms as well, or equip a single militant (Scale 0) with a firearm and a radio (one additional tag). • A badlands shaman who can burn two tags of spiritual powers from one guardian spirit (Scale 0), can still burn two tags of spiritual powers against a small group of guardian spirits (Scale 1) but can only burn one tag of a large group of guardian spirits (Scale 2). \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n For tags, if the Scale gap amplifies the Consequences, add one tag per two levels of Scale gap.

Order #218284 \\n SCALING MITIGATION \\n\\n Mitigating reactions are not affected by Scale. Scale is already factored into the attacker’s Power or Consequences and, therefore, PCs can mitigate Scaled Consequences normally. \\n COLLECTIVES \\n\\n A PC’s tag set or a Challenge that normally represents a single individual can be made to represent a group of individuals with similar abilities by adding Scale, turning it into a collective. When handling collectives, the MC should use an approxi- mate number of members, similarly to a movie, where the exact number of individuals in a collective is rarely given. When a collective takes the same action together, it is resolved in the same way as the action of an individual but with the application of the Scale gap as explained above. \\n BREAKING UP OR MERGING COLLECTIVES \\n\\n Depending on what’s happening in the narrative, the MC can break up a collective into smaller collectives or even individuals, or merge collectives or individuals into a greater collective. Larger collectives usually include two to four smaller collectives or individuals, of the level below them. For example, if a police drone squad of twelve are all taking the same action, such as scanning a Megacity block for fugitives, they can be regarded as Scale 2. If they later split into three teams of four, each pursuing a different fugitive, each such team can be regarded as Scale 1. If one of the teams gets into a conflict where each drone acts separately, each drone is regarded as Scale 0. Later, if all the drones converge on the conflict zone and attack the biggest threat there, they can be regarded as Scale 2 again (unless, by then, many of them were destroyed). \\n USING SCALED-UP EFFECTS \\n\\n UNRESISTED AREA OF EFFECT OR MULTIPLE TARGETS \\n\\n An unresisted Effect is an Effect that is welcomed by its targets or whose targets are unable to resist. This could entail, for example, a ward of protection cast by a theurgist around her vicinity to repel mythical monsters, or a fleet of medical droids deployed to remove injury statuses from a large group of people, or a smoke grenade thrown into an unsuspecting guard room. If the Effect is unresisted, the story tag or status immedi- ately affects the intended area or group of the Scale chosen. Once set up in this way, a Scaled-up Effect can be invoked in any action that affects anyone within that area or of that group, until it expires. The invocation of the story tag or status by one character does not limit its use by another character. For example, the aforementioned story tag ward of protection can be used by anyone within its boundaries. At the MC’s discretion, an Scaled-up story tag may be burned for Power separately by each individual target (for example, a chemist PC handing out a consumable booster drug that could accelerate reactions) or it may only be burned for Power by whoever controls the story tag, affecting the entire area at once (for example, the aforementioned theurgist burning her ward of protection to protect everyone from the rays of a Fomorian’s evil eye). \\n RESISTED AREA OF EFFECT OR MULTIPLE TARGETS \\n\\n A resisted Effect is an Effect that is unwanted or harmful to its targets and whose targets are actively resisting or attempting to avoid. The classic case of a resisted Scaled- up Effect is an Area of Effect attack such as sprayfire, an impressive speech, an explosive device, or a spell affect- ing all within earshot. It could also entail, for example, an EMP grenade thrown into the middle of a battleground, dealing depowered to all cybernetics nearby, or a homing corrosive nanite cloud consuming gear (and burning tags) on multiple targets. If an Effect is resisted, resisting targets within the affected area or a group can mitigate it before it applies. PCs affected make a roll to mitigate the story tag or status as they would Consequences (see Mitigating Effects, page 100). Challenges affected can reduce the Power of the Effect applied to them individually by retroactively apply- ing their tags and statuses, reducing the Power as usual. For example, a Siberian shaman PC unleashes the power of a plant-related Source to call upon the local flora to restrain-4 all corporate black ops operatives in his vicinity, including one PC who was hacked and taken over by the operatives. One of the operatives is on a strength-boost- ing drug (strengthened-2) and so only takes restrain-2, while the rest take the full status. The resisting PC rolls to Mitigate with a Power of 3, increasing it to 4 with a strong hit, and so avoids the grappling vines altogether.',\n",

       " ' - 4 5': '\\n\\n4 5\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n Status mitigation only applies to an incoming status and it is resolved before a status stacks with any existing statuses. Note that mitigation cannot reduce the tier of an existing status, it can only affect an incoming one. Reducing the tier of an existing status requires taking an action with the Restore, Set Back, or Weaken Effects. Challenges do not mitigate statuses; instead, they reduce incoming statuses by brandishing defensive statuses and tags, like shielded-3 or impervious to ridicule, weakening the PC’s Power to attack and inflict statuses on them. PCs and Challenges can remove statuses from themselves or from other characters and objects. This could represent the character fixing a malfunctioning-3 piece of tech, healing a comrade’s gunshot-wound-4, or dispelling an enemy’s protective spell that is keeping them warded-2.',\n",

The MC may choose to remove any number of statuses and any number of tiers when delivering Consequences. Challenge Profiles provide recommended statuses and tiers to remove based on the Challenge’s actions. When removing tiers from a stacked status, move each mark one box to the left for each tier removed, going from the lowest to the highest mark. A mark that is pushed past (lower than) tier 1 is removed (erased) completely. For example, if a character who is confident-2 then takes confident-4, they have confident-4 , with 2 and 4 marked. If someone then removes 1 tier of confidence from that character, both the 2 mark and the 4 mark are pushed 1 box left, resulting in 1 and 3 marks, or confident-3. If the status is instead reduced by 3 tiers, 4 is pushed to 1, and 2 is removed, resulting in confident-1. \\n\\n H O W TO P L AY \\n If a PC receiving an incoming status is able to Mitigate it and wishes to do so, the player may temporarily receive the spotlight (out of turn) to make a mitigation roll (see Mitigating Effects, page 112). If successful, the player can use the Mitigate Effect to reduce the tier of the status they would receive. For every point of Power spent on Mitigating, • PCs remove statuses using the Effects Weaken, Restore, or Set Back. Each tier removed costs 1 Power. \\n | \\n\\n 105 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

For example, software that was stuck-in-a-loop-3 and was debugged to tier 1 may now be only glitching-1. Statuses modify the Power of relevant PC actions. Like other tags, statuses can be irrelevant, positive, or negative for any specific action. When a PC takes action to which a status is relevant, they: • Subtract the tier of their highest negative status from the Power of the action (e.g., wanted-3 decreases the Power of an action to sneak by corporate police) • Add the tier of their highest positive status to the Power of the action (e.g., alert-2 increases the Power of an action to stand guard) \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n ROLLING WITH A STATUS \\n\\n 106 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n A status could be relevant whether it is attached to the acting character or to another character or object. For example, a PC who is unstable-2 and is shooting at a target that is behind-cover-4 across a dark-1 plaza, will be affected by all three statuses, but because only the highest negative status applies, their Power will be reduced by 4. Unlike PCs, Challenges don’t count Power and therefore are not affected by statuses in the same way. Instead, statuses on Challenges usually affect the Power of PC’s actions against them. An evasive-2 drone will impose -2 Power on a PC attempting to shoot it, while an off-balance-1 sniper will grant +1 Power to any PC attempting to push them over a ledge or mitigate their shot. The No Double Dipping rule (page 89) applies to all tags, including statuses. If both the action and the mitigation would be affected by the same status, it can only be ap- plied to the action and is ignored when counting Power for the mitigation. \\n LIMITS \\n\\n In addition to modifying the Power of PC actions, statuses indicate when a PC or a Challenge is overcome by a condition. The maximum tier of a status a PC or Challenge can take is called their Limit. When a PC or Challenge takes a status at their Limit tier, they are overcome or incapacitated, and cannot take any more actions to which this status applies. This is also referred to as maxing out the Limit. If they take a status at a tier higher than their Limit, the effects are per- manent, lethal, or transformative – the MC decides how so. Each status requires a different interpretation. If a PC is over- come due to being wounded, they could be incapacitated or out cold, with the next step being quite possibly lethal, meaning they have died. If they were overcome by being hypnotized, they may be completely given to their master’s control, while going over that Limit would mean they are permanently brain- washed. If they were overcome by being humiliated, perhaps they can no longer take social actions, and then become a social pariah if the status exceeds the Limit. All statuses can have a Limit, including positive ones. Too much of a good thing is dangerous, and even energized can turn negative when it reaches a Limit, incapacitating and even killing the affected character. A PC that is overcome in one aspect may still be able to take actions with other faculties. For example, if a PC is restrained-5, they may still be able to talk themselves out of a bad spot. This is not usually the case for Challenges (see Overcoming Challenges, below). The default Limit for PCs for any status is tier 5, with tier 6 becoming permanent (see the Optional Rules: Deadly Conflicts for alternatives). \\n OVERCOMING CHALLENGES \\n\\n Challenges have a different Limit for each status that could normally overcome them and these are listed in the Challenge profile.

There are many different statuses of physical harm or subdual that could go towards this Limit, and the MC should allow different forms of harm or subdual to stack. Depending on the force used, maxing out this Limit could mean anything from restraint to incapacitation, and exceeding the Limit could mean anything from surrender to death. • Convince, threaten: A Challenge with this Limit is harder to sway than most; a quick outcome won’t cut it and the PCs will have to max out this Limit in order to get the Challenge to take a desired action. (The MC can always ignore this if she chooses to go with a quick outcome.) • Banish: A Challenge with this Limit is usually a Conjuration created by a Source, and can be mystically overcome and expelled from the scene. • Crash or take-over: This Limit represents crashing or taking control of a network node. When maxed out, it can no longer act against the PCs, either because it is inoperational or under the PCs’ control. This could be applied to a physical piece of tech, such as a server, a drone, or cyberware, or to a digital entity, like a domain, a program or a Harnessed avatar. \\n\\n H O W TO P L AY \\n If you want to play an even grittier, deadlier game, consider lowering the default Limit for PCs to 4 (5 is permanent) or even 3 (4 is permanent). PCs must then rely more heavily on their tags to shield them from incoming statuses. Lowering this default limit will lead to PCs looking for cover at every opportunity, always attempting to have the element of surprise, and still becoming incapacitated or defeated, and possibly dying, much more often. This in turn will give your game a more bleak outlook. \\n Here are some common Limits you will encounter: \\n | \\n\\n 107 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield.

If those fleeing max out outrun, they escape their pursuer. The MC may come up with new Limits for a Challenge on the fly. This could be useful when the PCs give a Challenge a status that would lead to overcoming it but the Challenge doesn’t list a Limit for the specific status that the PCs are imposing. Or, the players or the MC have come up with a new way this Challenge can be overcome, and the MC would like to reflect it with a Limit. The tier of the Limit determines how hard it is to overcome the Challenge in this new way. For example, Wilson and Unagi are fighting some Nezumi gangsters on a high hanging cable bridge in the Ghost Market. Unagi uses her climbing gear to swing into the gangsters and knock them off the bridge, giving them knocked-over and hopefully not falling over herself. Since falling off the bridge would spell instant death, the MC determines this will lead to the gangsters’ defeat, \\n Common',\n",

When a Challenge is overcome by maxing out their Limit, they cease posing a problem for the PCs in the narrative. A tactical drone can be destroyed:3, a skyscraper could be scaled:4, or a rogue AI controlled:3; in either case they no longer pose an issue for the PCs. Some Challenges are immune to certain statuses. Such immunities are listed as a Limit of –. For example, a ghost could have a hurt:– immunity. \\n DURATION OF STATUSES \\n\\n Statuses stay in the game until removed or until they expire in the narrative. For example, a PC who is life-of-the-party-2 will remain so until the status is removed by another PC or the MC, until they leave, or until the party ends. Unless their tier exceeds a specific Limit, statuses are not meant to stay in the game permanently and should expire after a while. When a status turns permanent because it exceeded a Limit, the MC chooses how to interpret it in the narrative. \\n POLAR STATUSES \\n\\n Some statuses are the polar opposite of others: hot/cold, friendly/hostile, hidden/exposed, and so on. A PC or a Challenge can never have two polar statuses at the same time. When a character receives a status that is opposite to an existing status they have, remove a number of tiers in the greater status equal to the tier of the lower status. If the incoming status is greater, change the tag of the status to the new polarity. For example, if a character who is hostile-3 takes a friendly-2 status, they become hostile-1 (3 - 2 = 1). If the same hostile-3 character took friendly-4 instead, they would become friendly-1 (3 - 4 = -1). \\n COMPELLING STATUSES \\n\\n A compelling status is a status that includes a directive, explicit or implicit, and which therefore compels the target to act according to that directive. This could be enraged, hacked, hypnotized, charmed, friendly, convinced, and so on. When a PC takes a compelling status, it hinders every action that PC takes that goes against the directive of the status. If the directive is to take specific action, such as attacking an ally, even trying to avoid taking this action by doing nothing is considered an action modified by the status. At tier 5, the player is unable to even attempt actions that go against the directive. If the status grants complete control over the PC (such as brainwashed), the player temporarily loses control of the PC to their controller (whether the MC or another player’s PC). At tier 6, these effects become permanent. When a Challenge takes a compelling status and attempts to act against its directive, the PCs can use it as a helpful status when mitigating the Challenge’s actions. For exam- ple, an adversary that is charmed-4 and who attempts to attack the PCs grants 4 additional points to the Power of the mitigating action. If a Challenge Limit is maxed out by a compelling status, it temporarily cannot take actions that go against the directive. If the status grants complete control over the Challenge (such as brainwashed), the MC temporarily loses control of the Challenge, who then be- comes a secondary character for the controlling PC. The MC should provide the player of the controlling PC with story tags to represent this new secondary character. When the Limit is exceeded by 1 tier or more, these effects become permanent (although any story tags representing the controlled Challenge may still expire normally). \\n PROGRESS STATUSES \\n\\n Statuses can be used to track progress towards a goal or a definitive moment, such as constructing a tank drone, per- forming a ritual, completing a transformation, or charging up a weapon. Such a status is referred to as a progress status. PCs and Challenges add to a progress status and reduce it as usual by using Effects; PCs specifically use Advance to add to a progress status and Set Back to reduce it. Based on the narrative, actions that push the process towards completion add to the status, while actions that reverse progress reduce the status (e.g., sabotaging the construc- tion of the tank drone) or give it the opposite statuses (see Polar Statuses above). When the Limit of a progress status is maxed out, the goal is achieved or the turning point happens: the tank is built, the ritual is complete, or the weapon is charged-up. Narrative events and special rules may be triggered at this point, regardless of who has the spotlight: the PC’s rival reveals their new tank, a hungry ghost is summoned into the scene, or the wielder of the charged-up weapon fires it. Depending on the narrative logic of the status, progress statuses may ignore the rules on overcoming a PC or Challenge by hitting or exceeding their Limits. A PC who has been working on a project or a Challenge who is cast- ing a ritualistic spell is not overcome when they max out their own progress status (rather, the task is “overcome” and completed). Similarly, a PC who is chasing a thief and maxes out the thief’s catch status does not automatically overcome the thief, but they have them pinned down. On the other hand, some Challenges are all about their prog- ress Limits: a PC traversing through a wasteland Challenge and completing the journey does overcome the Challenge. \\n OPTIONAL',\n",
       " ' - 1': '\\n\\n1\\nRULE: STOPPING THE DEATH SPIRAL \\n\\n By default, :Otherscape is in Death Spiral Mode: getting hurt makes it more likely to get even more hurt. For example, when you injure an enemy, this status could empower your next attack against them (e.g., if they can’t dodge or take cover) or it could empower your mitigation of their attacks (e.g., if they can’t aim well). The same is true about you: when you get injured, it can increase the chances of failing your next action, which could then result in getting even more hurt as Conse- quences, or it could make it harder to mitigate incoming damage. (A status can’t affect both action and mitigation at the same time, see No Double Dipping, page 89). This reflects the dire straits of dystopian cyberpunk fiction: life is cheap, combat is fast and brutal, and the first shot that hits you might mean you’re already dead. Things tend to rapidly deteriorate, forcing the protago- nists to make greater sacrifices to stay in the game (see Power Options, page 121). Optionally, you can remove the death spiral by adding a simple rule: a status that counts against a Limit cannot empower actions that add statuses to that Limit (or depower actions that mitigate them). With this rule, being injured doesn’t directly affect a character’s chances of survival; it only measures how close they are to being overcome. This in turn will slow down conflict, allowing the PCs to make some mistakes and adjust their strategy. \\n\\n H O W TO P L AY \\n Progress statuses are most often used to track Challenges as they build up towards a major Consequence or when tracking a Challenge progress against a PC’s. However, the MC can track a PC’s narrative goal with such a status, for example, promotion:4. If a PC wants to achieve a goal that has game effects beyond just the narrative, they should instead use Effects or replace a theme, and describe the outcome using tags and/or statuses. \\n | \\n\\n 109 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " ' -  - OPTIONAL RULE: STOPPING THE DEATH SPIRAL': '\\n\\n\\nOPTIONAL RULE: STOPPING THE DEATH SPIRAL\\n\\n\\n <1 MIN \\n Read this the first time a PC or a Challenge creates, removes, or recovers a tag: \\n\\n Story tags are situational tags that de- scribe new or temporary things, beings, and abilities in a scene like a gyrocycle, a water nymph, or seeing through walls. Unlike power or weakness tags, story tags are tem- porary and expire when the MC deems so. You can take action and use the Effects Create and Bestow to add new story tags that describe things, beings, and abilities. You can use multiple story tags to describe dif- ferent aspects of the same thing. The more story tags something has, the more impact it will have on the game. Challenges often have story tags that make things harder for your PC, and they can use Consequences to take away your story tags and burn your power tags. You can use Weaken to take away their story tags and Restore to regain your lost tags. \\n HACKING DEEPER \\n\\n Story tags are situational tags that describe things, char- acters, qualities, and abilities that exist in a scene or over several scenes. They are a versatile tool that can be used to describe anything of importance in your group’s narrative, from the environment, through items and tools, to allies and special abilities. \\n CREATING STORY TAGS \\n\\n PCs and Challenges can create story tags and give them to themselves or to other characters and objects. A survivalist that fumbles in their backpack can produce polymer rope, a mercenary that throws a smoke grenade can create smoke, a corporate wizard adept in hermetic magic can create a homunculus, a cursed vagabond can brand another character with the Mark of Cain, or a character that can build devices can equip another character with a jetpack. \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Story tags are used to increase or decrease the Power of player actions, just like a PC’s power or weakness tags. However, they are not inherently positive or negative for a PC, and are judged on a case-by-case basis based on the situation and the manner in which they are used. Every relevant story tag increases an action’s Power by 1 if it’s directly helpful to the action, or decreases it by 1 if it’s directly impeding the action. Unlike weakness tags, however, story tags invoked as negative tags do not lead you to mark an Upgrade. \\n\\n 110 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n • Players and their PCs create story tags using the Effects Bestow, Create, or Disrupt. Each story tag costs 2 Power. PCs may create any number of tags as their Power allows. • The MC and her Challenges create story tags as Conse- quences. The MC may choose to create any number of story tags when delivering Consequences. Challenge Profiles provide recommended story tags to create based on the Challenge’s actions. • The MC may add story tags at any point as an interjection, if they better describe the scene. However, story tags that directly weaken the PCs or strengthen their adversaries are usually either already present when the scene is established, or added as Consequences. Challenges enter the scene with the story tags given under the Tags & Statuses section of their Challenge profile already in play. Challenges may have suggested Consequences or special abilities that allow them to create story tags. \\n EXAMPLES FOR ACTIONS THAT CAN CREATE STORY TAGS \\n\\n • Item procurement: buying, stealing, pickpocketing, looting, recovering from storage, intimidating someone to hand over items, etc. • Crafting: making, building, manufacturing, synthesizing, engineering, smithing, designing, carving, sculpting, drawing, composing, etc. • Calling on allies: rallying, recruiting, hiring, summon- ing (beings), deploying (drones), calling someone over, loading (software), etc. • Shaping the environment: creating terrain, affecting the atmosphere, deploying materials, altering the lighting, etc. • Granting abilities: learning a new spell, dispensing a booster drug, disseminating new software, installing upgrades, etc. \\n WHO CONTROLS THE TAG \\n\\n When a new story tag is created, it is usually either attached to someone or something, such as a PC creating a magical sword for themselves (attached to the PC) or a Challenge spewing forth a cloud of smog (attached to the environ- ment), or it is autonomous, representing an individual being, such as a PC summoning an ifrit. Regardless, the creator of the tag is usually in control of it: the PC can give the magical sword to someone else, the Challenge can breathe more soot into the cloud of smog, adding more tags to it, or the PC can control the actions of their summoned ifrit. When a PC creates an autonomous tag, such as the ifrit, that being becomes a secondary character of that PC. The player who controls that PC can now take actions with the autonomous being when they get the spotlight. If the PC creates tags that refer to an already existing NPC, such as Mutblade the mercenary, the MC rules whether the NPC becomes the PC’s secondary character, or whether the tags can be used to influence the NPC as a Challenge. It is possible for a PC or a Challenge to lose control over their tags. There are several ways in which a character can take control over another character’s tags; the MC chooses which of these should be used in any given circumstances. • Narratively, based on how events unfold. • By using compelling statuses. This is most appropriate for tags that represent beings. When the compelling status exceeds a Limit set by the MC, the character who imposed the compelling status takes over the tag(s). As a guideline, the Limit should be equal to the number of story tags used to describe the being. \\n Playing',\n",
       " ' -  - Playing with secondary pcs': '\\n\\n\\nPlaying with secondary pcs\\nwith secondary pcs \\n\\n A secondary player character is any character a player controls other than their main PC, such as rallied allies or summoned beings. It may be represented by one or more power, weakness, loadout, or story tags. A player may take action with a secondary PC in the same way they take action with their main PC (Taking Action, page 10). The MC rules whether the secondary PC gets their own spotlight or whether the player must choose which PC to act with whenever they get the spotlight. A secondary PC takes Consequences, and specifically statuses, independently; these affect actions taken with the secondary PC as they would any PC. The MC may set Limits for a secondary PC, usually equal to the total number of tags describing them, but no more than 5 (the main PCs’ default Limit). \\n TRIGGERING',\n",
       " ' -  - TRIGGERING STORY TAGS OUT OF TURN': '\\n\\n\\nTRIGGERING STORY TAGS OUT OF TURN\\n\\n\\n 1-2 MIN \\n Read this the first time the PCs are getting ready for a job: \\n\\n Before you set out on a job, you get to pack some useful gear. This equipment comes from your loadout theme, which holds power tags that represent tools, weapons, ammo and ev- erything else that is available to you. \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n All loadout tags start out burnt. Before every job, when I (the MC) say it’s time to Load Up, you may spend 1 Power to recover any of your loadout tags at the cost of 1 Power per tag (you can later increase this Loading Up Power). You can then use these tags throughout the job like any other power tag. Once the job ends, I say we Load Off, and burn all remaining loadout tags. 114 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Choose the tags that seem most useful for the coming job. Your loadout tags aren’t necessarily the only items you take with you, but they’re the most important. Think of it like in a movie, where we see the protagonist select a few items as they gear up – obviously they take a few more items as well, but those are less important. When loading up, you can also choose to spend 2 Power to gain a wildcard loadout tag, which is like an empty equipment slot, waiting to be filled up. You can then choose one of your loadout tags to activate during the job, and we say your PC, being a pro, packed it ahead of time. \\n HACKING DEEPER \\n\\n A PC’s gear can be described by different tags. Power tags that describe equipment represent gear that is at the core of the character, so they somehow always keep it at hand. Story tags can represent makeshift or temporary gear, or items the character acquired for a specific purpose and might not use again. In addition to those, every PC has a loadout theme, a fifth theme beyond their core four themes. The loadout tags in this theme represent the resources the PC has access to but doesn’t keep on themselves at all times: items in storage, weapons that can be borrowed from allies, access that can be especially requested or bought through a channel the PC has opened in the past, etc. Loadout tags are power tags, but they are burnt by default. They must be Loaded Up as explained below in order to become available, at which point they can be used like every other power tag: they can be burned for Power (page 122), burned by Consequences, recovered with Restore, etc. Tags on the loadout theme that weren’t loaded up do not affect gameplay. They might still represent physical items in your possession, but those are either not immediately available, or require some maintenance, ammo, or permis- sion before using that you don’t immediately have. The loadout theme cannot be replaced or lost, and it can’t Decay – but it can be upgraded (see the next section). \\n LOADOUT TAG SETS \\n\\n Multiple loadout tags can be used to describe specific features that make a piece of gear more useful in narrow situations. For example, a sniper rifle can have telescopic thermal sight, high-caliber rounds, and gyro stabilizers. When firing at an armored target on a windy night (in other words, when this gun is used in the specific conditions it’s ideal for), this gun can add up to +4 to Power, invoking all four tags. \\n LOADOUT WEAKNESS TAGS & THEME UPGRADES \\n\\n Whenever a new loadout tag or a set of tags that represent an item are added to a player’s loadout theme, the player or MC may add one weakness tag to that item to represent the flaws of that piece of equipment. At the end of downtime or before going out to a new job, the MC may declare a Loading Up moment: \\n LOADING UP POWER \\n\\n Each player gains 1 Power to spend on loading up tags from their loadout theme. This base Loading Up Power can be increased with Load- out Theme Upgrades, by using some Power gained from downtime (page 124), or by invoking directly relevant power tags. Power tags that directly help with packing and carrying items can add to a PC’s Loading Up Power, adding 1 Power per tag. This may include power tags such as carrying capacity, preparedness, toolbelt, or tons of RAM. At the MC’s discretion, weakness tags (such as physically weak or heavy ammunition) can reduce the PC’s Loading Up Power by 1 Power each, but each time this occurs, the PC marks an upgrade box as usual on that weakness tag’s theme. \\n CHOOSING LOADOUT TAGS \\n\\n Players then spend this Power to recover (unburn) their chosen loadout tag(s) at the cost of 1 Power per tag. If an item has a set of tags representing it, each tag must be loaded up separately and the first tag must be loaded up before any other tags describing features of that item. Mark the loaded up tags by unchecking their burnt checkbox on the loadout theme card. As always, Loading Up is also limited by the situation and narrative conditions. If a PC has regular access to the loadout tag booster drug in the Megacity, but they are now Loading Up in the middle of the wilderness, they may not be able to load up that specific loadout tag. \\n WILDCARD LOADOUT TAGS \\n\\n When Loading Up, a player may also choose to spend Power on wildcard loadout tags. These are unspecified “tag slots” that can be used to load up any tag from the PC’s loadoud theme at any time during the job, revealing new gear that the PC has packed in advance. This represents a character who is prepared for the situation at hand, even if the player did not yet know what gear was needed. The downside to this freedom is a cost of 2 Power per tag. Once a wildcard loadout tag was used to load up a specific loadout tag, it cannot be changed. \\n\\n H O W TO P L AY \\n A loadout weakness tag can be invoked by the player or the MC, reducing the Power of an affected action by 1, as normal – and the player gets to mark an upgrade box on their loadout theme. When the loadout theme upgrade track is full, the theme gains an upgrade and the track is reset. See Loadout Theme Upgrades (page 134). \\n LOADING UP \\n\\n | \\n\\n 115 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n SHARING',\n",
       " ' -  - SHARING GEAR': '\\n\\n\\nSHARING GEAR\\nGEAR \\n\\n During downtime, players can have their characters exchange items on their loadout themes, provided they represent items that can be given and would still operate in the same manner, that is, are not custom- ized or tailored to the original owner. Similarly, during a job, a PC can pass their active loadout tags to another PC, with the same caveat. If passing the item between the PCs is uncertain and dramatic, the MC may ask the player to take action to determine if it can be done (usually resolved as a quick outcome). \\n CATALOGS',\n",
       " ' -  - CATALOGS': '\\n\\n\\nCATALOGS\\n\\n\\n Catalogs are premade lists of loadout tags you can pick from to add to your loadout theme. The Street Catalog (page 252) lists commonly available items in the Meg- acity that PCs could usually obtain by taking an action. Loot catalogs are lists of items the PCs find, such as a stash or a database, and are usually a reward for a successful job. You can find an example of a loot catalog in the starter job, Strings Attached (page 351). \\n Limited',\n",
       " 'CINEMATIC MOMENTS': 'CINEMATIC MOMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n SUSPEND \\n\\n When a PC is about to do something dramatic whose outcome won’t be known for a while, the MC can ask them to suspend their roll to add suspense to the scene. While the PC takes the action as described, the outcome of the action remains unknown. The player only rolls to determine the outcome when something occurs in the story that puts that action to the test. This can be used to describe the PC setting a trap (roll when the trap is triggered), the PC making a threat (roll if threat is ignored), or the PC trying to pass as someone else (roll when the disguise comes under scrutiny). Before infiltrating an NM3 factory, a shapeshifting sha- man PC dashes into a nearby alley and transforms into one of the organization’s corporate executives. Instead of asking the player to roll now and reveal how well the shapeshifting worked before walking into the building, the MC asks the player to suspend the roll until they are faced with some form of scrutiny, presumably at the lobby or some other entrance, when the stakes are higher. \\n FLASHBACK \\n\\n A player may ask the MC to use their spotlight to flash back to a past event that involved their PC. This could be used to share new information about the character’s past or to reveal how the character had prepared for the present mo- ment in advance. The MC rules whether this is appropriate based on her cinematic considerations. While in flashback, the player may take a player action; the outcome and Consequences of this action are revealed when the narrative returns to the present moment. Alternatively, the MC may forgo the roll and grant the PC specific ben- eficial or hindering story tags or statuses based on their narration of the flashback. Once the flashback is over, the MC rules whether the PC gets to keep the spotlight. If the PC flashed back just be- fore a mitigation roll, they should still be able to take that roll and use the benefits of the flashback to empower it. Whenever a PC encounters an obstacle in their heist, the player can flashback to the Prep Sequence and describe an action the PC took in the past which would help them now, such as casing the target or securing the help of an NPC. The Effects and Consequences of the action both af- fect the present moment: if a PC gained the help of a NPC, that NPC is revealed to be their co-conspirator; if a PC got injured or tagged while securing the help of that NPC, it is now revealed to be a problem for them during the heist. A common Consequence in a heist would be to deny the PC future flashbacks to the Prep Sequence, indicating they ran out of time for planning and preparing in the past, and now must rely on their resourcefulness. A shadowy operative is infiltrating a Source-powered drug lab guarded by a nefarious gang of smugglers. As she rappels onto the roof of the building, the player flashes back to a week earlier, when the operative had been casing her mark. Using the Discover Effect, the player reveals the timing of the guard patrols and the cursed glyphs placed upon the doors. However, the MC gives the guards on-high-alert-1 as a Consequence. Back in the present, the operative uses this knowledge to sneak past the guards, albeit not with- out difficulty. Just as she reaches the backdoor, the player flashes back again to the operative purchasing a dispelling incantation from a street Source-peddler before the mis- sion. Rolling a miss, back in the present the PC discovers the incantation is a dud, and must find another way to get in, while the next patrol closes in on her. While it may be used to reveal previously stashed gear (using Create), a flashback should not be used to Load Up (page 115). Instead, use wildcard loadout tags to indicate a PC’s general preparedness in terms of gear that they packed in advance. \\n CREDIT ROLL \\n\\n At the end of each session, as the imaginary credits are rolling, take some time to discuss what has transpired in this episode of your series. • What did the crew achieve? What new trouble did they get into? \\n\\n H O W TO P L AY \\n An android PC is fighting an invasive software virus that threatens to eradicate their self-awareness and subjugate them to human overlords (controlled-6). When mitigating this Consequence, the player flashes back to a story of how the PC first became aware after the programmer-priest who built them spent his last breath for a prayer that gave them a ‘soul’. Inspired, the MC decides to give the player a status determined-to-stay-me-3. \\n HEISTS \\n\\n Flashbacks may be especially common during heists. Instead of playing through a long and tedious planning and preparation scene, the MC can start the job as normal and then allow the players to cut the action and flashback to a Prep Sequence, in the spirit of popular heist movies, where preparation is shown side-by-side with execution. \\n | \\n\\n 125 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

It’s in the disclaimer etched on a plastic plaque in the lobby. \\n After a successful hacking session against Epis International, the crew discover that a tracing program geo-located them. They now must battle a swarm of Epis security drones sent to snuff them out, while fleeing the sleazy Harnessing salon they were hacking from. \\n\\n TJ: Classy. Okay, I’m going to set up a fire- wall on this joint, try to hold the tactical hacker off. MC: (Establishing the scene) Malcolm, Amal, you disconnect from VR and find yourselves in the same Harnessing beds you lay in when you jacked in: two of five daybeds arranged in a star shape in a seedy circular room, lined with flickering magenta neon and vague- ly sensual AR layers. This is just one room of many in this divey Harnessing salon. The beds are just as grimy as they were when you laid on them a few minutes ago; you still don’t want to know how they got that way.

TJ: Rayth hollers down the comms, “Malcolm, quick, open the door!” MC: (Re-establishing the scene) While Rayth has been firewalling, not a lot has changed in meatspace. The five-bed room is still suspiciously sticky. Epis is still coming at you. What do you do? (At this point, the MC doesn’t add any new threats) Matt: (Picking up the spotlight, narrating) Hearing Rayth on the comms, (moving) Mal- colm bolts to the door and tries to slide it open. MC: The door won’t budge. Looks like it’s magnetically locked. \\n\\n H O W TO P L AY \\n TJ: (Naturally picks up the spotlight) Crap. Okay. (Starting Player Action, Narrating) Rayth patches into comms and says: (Convers- ing) “Rise and shine, sleeping beauties. We MC: Go ahead and roll. We’ll make it a quick outcome. \\n | \\n\\n 127 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Matt: Okay, then brute force it is. Malcolm will try to rip the door open with his cyberarms and boosted servo-motors. Any opposition? MC: I’d say lockdown virus is working against you here. You’re pushing the sliding doors apart, while it’s commanding them to shut. Matt: Power of 1 then. Woo! I rolled an 11, a total of 12. Celine: I got 1 and 3, what the hell! Total of 7, mixed hit. MC: That’s a strong hit, no Consequences. And a quick outcome will do here. I guess these doors aren’t really made to stop augs like yours. You can keep the spot- light, if you want. MC: This is a tracked fight so go ahead and spend that 3 Power on Effects. Celine: I spend all 3 Power on Attack. That’s a status tier per point of Power, so I’m go- ing to give them the status bleeding-3. Matt: Sure! I throw my hood on and pop my head out of the door to the hallway. What’s happening there? MC: The HURT officer falls over with the force of your ferocious lunge, and soon crimson rivers start gushing from their armor weak spot on their neck. However, this was a mixed hit, so there are Consequences, in this case a counterattack. (Delivering Con- sequences from the HURT Officer’s Challenge Profile) Having seen you a moment before you jumped, the HURT officer managed to let out a burst of gunfire at you, dealing gunshot-3. You can mitigate. MC: (Re-Establishing) Unlike the quiet Har- nessing suite, the hallway is loud and busy. Wicked-sounding electronic music is thudding hard bass into your chests and screeching noise into your ears. There is a constant flow of patrons, each stranger than the next, going up and down the hallway floor, a met- al catwalk hanging over broiling AR images. Far ahead, where the hallway meets the lobby – and the exit door – you see a HURT offi- cer accompanied by three Epis drones, white floating metal orbs with a single red eye and a compact gun hanging below them like a wasp’s stinger. They haven’t spotted you yet. What do you do? Matt: (To Celine) Malcolm looks at Amal. “What do we do?” Celine: Amal replies curtly, “Take them down, get to the door, and whatever you do – don’t let them see your face.” And then she begins to shapeshift into a hyena, strands of smoke and fire and shadows flashing over her twist- ing body. Matt: Since Malcolm is going to follow Amal’s lead, I think you should take the spotlight first, Celine. Celine: Cool. (Player Action). So Amal is go- ing for the kill. She’ll rush out the door, slip through the crowd and catch the HURT of- ficer unawares, rip out their jugular. Amal’s got werehyena form, baleful bite, and blood- thirsty. I’m going to burn baleful bite for Power, which means it will be worth 3 Power instead of 1. So that’s a total of 5 Power. TJ: Yikes! MC: Nothing like Amal going balls to the wall. Okay let’s see. (Reviewing the HURT Officer \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Challenge Profile) The officer has body armor, which reduces your Power by 1, and interest- ingly this also triggers your weak against armored foes weakness tag, which takes it down by another 1. This brings your Power to 3, but also you get to mark an upgrade box on your Werehyena Form theme. Roll’em! 128 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Celine: Not a lot for a hyena to mitigate gunfire with, which is why I went in so hard. I guess quick reflexes works here, if I was moving fast enough. (The MC confirms with a nod.) I roll, 5 and 5 with 1 Power, for a total of 11. Strong hit! I mitigate with 2 Power instead of 1, dropping it from gunshot-3 to scrape-1. Phew. MC: (Re-establishing) The sound of gunshots sends the crowd around you screaming and scam- pring in every direction, clearing the hall- way in seconds. Some people reach for their firearms, one person disappears, some form of camouflage magic or tech. You, Amal, land on all fours with blood dripping from your maw, surrounded by a HURT officer who is rapidly bleeding to death and three whirring orb-like drones… (making a Threat from the drones’ Challenge Profile) who now prop their guns up- wards and scan you as their new target. Matt: “Rayth, we need help down here, man.” TJ: (Player Action, narrating, perceiving) What links is Rayth seeing in these drone’s aura? Are they linked to the Nearspace of the salon? MC: Nah, they’re too smart for that in Epis. But from your perspective, it looks like they run a long-range link through which they are piloted and/or get their commands. TJ: Rayth is going to tap that and try to give them a delay order. I’m mostly trying to disrupt their operation and soften them up for Malcolm and Amal. I’ll invoke disembodied hacker, master of exploits, and hostile takeover, as well as my loadout tag crypto- breaker software because I just know these Epis drones comms are encrypted. Power of 4. MC: (Checks the drones’ Challenge Profile) And you’re not wrong. Their defensive suite is represented by the status firewalled-2 and they have a Scale gap of 1 over you. So that’s a Power of 1 now. TJ: Okay, rolled a 3 and 6, yes! That’s a 10 total with the Power. I’m going to use this strong hit for all its worth and push it, to increase my Power from 1 to 2, I’ll take the Consequences. Then I’ll use Disrupt to give them all a negative status, delayed-2. MC: The drones’ main eye light gutters and flickers momentarily. For Consequences, I’m going to burn that loadout tag crypto- breaker software, because once one of these babies go out into the net, they update their firewalls against it. (Upgrading the drones’ Threat into the Consequences listed in their Challenge Profile, dealing a harmful status) Also, the drones’ Threat against Amal hasn’t really been eliminated, they are just delayed in their response, so they do fire their miniguns at her, but the delayed-2 status will be in your favor as you mitigate, Celine. One drone deals gunshot-3, so with the Scale gap they deal gunshot-4. Celine: Hmm so I’ve got quick reflexes and their delayed-2, for a Power of 3. Don’t fail me now, dice! I rolled 5 and 1, for a total of 9. Mixed hit. I mitigate 3 of the 4 tiers, and keep another scraped-1. But I already have scraped-1 so I guess it bumps up to flesh-wound-2. I howl, which you guys know means “Need some help here, people! I’m cornered!” MC: (Re-establishing, making a Threat from the HURT Officer Challenge Profile) To add to your troubles, the HURT officer seems to be fumbling for something in their personal kit. Matt? MC: They have the Scale advantage, and they are steel-plated, so back to 4 Power. Matt: Whatever, I rolled boxcars! Going to push for 1 extra Power and take Consequenc- es. That’s 5 Power to spend. I’ll spend 4 on Attack, dealing perforated-4 to each of them, and 1 on an Extra Feat. I want to end with a trick shot shooting whatever that was the HURT officer just pulled out of their pocket. MC: Good call! That was a syringe, which would have patched them up enough to keep fighting, but instead just shatters in their glove, as they slump in place, dazed from loss of blood. (MC Raycheal reviews the Challenges Limits: the drones have wreck:2, and they each took perforated-4 which means all of them have maxed out Limits and are permanently out of the picture. The HURT officer has hurt:4, which has not yet been maxed out with their bleeding-3.). Let’s talk Consequences. As they were disintegrat- ed by your armor-piercing rounds, the drones focused on capturing and broadcasting enough footage of you for Epis to ID you. It may not have been great, but you can assume they got something (Narrative Consequences). TJ: “They got a snapshot of you, Mal. Sorry, buddy, I should have blocked their uplink.” Matt: “Bugger that. Saving our four-legged mate was more important.” I guess I should have used my Extra Feat on keeping my hood down! Celine: I’d say something warm and fuzzy but I’m a bloodthirsty hyena at the moment. MC: (Re-establishes and decides to make a subtle Threat and see if the players respond to it) The HURT officer is on the verge of consciousness, bobbing in a pool of their own blood. (And, remembering the Epis Tac- tical Hacker, makes another, more pressing Threat) Rayth, the firewall you put around the salon’s Nearspace is coming under a lot of pressure from that tactical hacker, as many green tentacles press against your sheet of bright energy. It won’t last long. TJ: “We can’t do this forever. I’m going to run a virus on the nearby block to mask your escape, so public devices and sensors can’t detect you. Make a run for it. NOW!” (Player Action) I’m using disembodied hacker, master of exploits, breakneck programming, and I’m going to burn my Wildfire X3 virus deployer to hit that network hard. Power of 6. \\n\\n H O W TO P L AY \\n Matt: (Player Action) Malcolm rushes out of the Harnessing suite and into the hallway with a machine pistol in each hand, spray firing at the drones. Luckily, Amal is quite short in their hyena form so hoping that would go over their head. I’m going to invoke machine pistols, dual firearm fighting, smart gun, and armor-piercing rounds from my loadout. Also they are delayed-2, so Power of 6, baby! \\n | \\n\\n 129 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield.

Also, the public system is equipped with a firewalled-2, cour- tesy of Epis International, which may or may not have been deployed a few minutes ago. TJ: These bastards. Okay, Power of 3. I rolled a total of 10! Strong hit. Going to push for a Power of 4 and Enhance both these chomps with masked-4. MC: Nice, that will be hard to trace. As a Consequence, the firewall you place on the salon is shattered, as you see many green tentacles of code breaking through. (Re-es- tablishing) Amal, Malcolm, the lobby is empty and most patrons who haven’t fled are crouched behind the furniture, some with weapon in hand, watching with interest. What do you do? Celine: Make a run for it! Malcolm should go first, as my hyena isn’t really aware of all the cyberspace mumbo jumbo and is just fol- lowing. Matt: Malcolm is making a run for it, then! I guess cyber legs and boosted servo-motors work here. MC: No opposition, incredibly. Matt: I roll 5 and 6 for a total of 13. Strong hit. I dash through the hallway and past HyenAmal, keeping my guns up and ready as I move through the lobby and towards the exit. MC: You make it out. No signs of danger on the street. Out of a dozen cameras, more than half are shattered or sprayed over, and the rest can’t see you, to believe Rayth. However, there are some Consequences. MC: Yes, but a Threat has not been addressed. (Revealing the narrative Consequences of the HURT Officer’s previous Threat) Amal, even as a hyena you can tell the HURT officer is mum- bling and chucking through his bloody teeth. The green LED on their comms is blinking. Suddenly, a squad of six HURT officers burst into the lobby from adjacent hallways, with their rifles pointing at you. Celine: Crap. (Sighs deeply). Okay, I’m rock- ing a flesh-wound-2 here, this is not looking good. Matt: I’m coming back in! Celine: Don’t, they’re too many. I didn’t max that one officer with bleeding-3 so they are all at least hurt:4, with a body armor tag. And Scale 1, at least. It’s a tough fight. I’m going to Go Out In A Blaze. \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Matt: But I rolled a strong hit! 130 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n TJ: Aaand here goes the werehyena. MC: What does it look like? Celine: I’m basically going to transform into an eight-foot-tall hyena-human hybrid and tear them to shreds. MC: Cool! That sounds like a No-Return. What is your most affected theme? Celine: I hate to say it, but it’s my Witch Esoterica theme. The more I succumb to the Evil Eye, the less I can manipulate it. Okay, I have two Mythos themes so I roll and add 2. Please please please…. 2 and 6! Yes! Total of 10! MC: Lucky puppy! So, as a Consequence, all your Witch theme power tags will be burnt, as your feral instincts take over. It’s going to be temporary, though. We can fade to black here, I think. Maybe we see HyenAmal breaking through the front door, much to Malcolm’s amazement. As they collapse and transform back to their human self, Malcolm sees the carnage in the lobby. His cyber muscles whirr as he picks them up on his shoulder and flees the scene, with ev- ery camera and sensor on the street turning away from them as they move past, thanks to their guardian angel, Rayth. What a rush! Time for some downtime. You’re loading off, so scratch out all your loadout tags. Matt: I figure we will go to some paid coffin motel to recoup. Malcolm is feeling guilty for leaving Amal behind with those corporate security, so he’s going to channel that into being better prepared. I’m spending my 3 Power on boosting my next Loading Up. Celine: Amal sleeps for 17 hours before recov- ering from that transformation, during which they are haunted by nightmares of the Evil Eye. I’ll spend 2 Power on Restoring my flesh- wound-2 and 1 Power to Restore my main Witch power tag that was burnt. I still have three power tags burnt, my baleful bite and my other Witch tags, so not feeling great here! TJ: Rayth is also preparing but in a differ- ent way. I will mark an upgrade box on my Database Beast theme, which will bring me up to three boxes. For my Upgrade, I’m going to pick a new power tag, Epis cyber tactics, as Rayth is now more familiar with the code they use. MC: Looks like you guys are more or less ready for action! Let’s Load Up and start the next scene on your job.',\n",
       " 'UPGRADES': 'UPGRADES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n A PC’s themes grow by gaining upgrades. Each theme has its own upgrade track with three boxes and it evolves independently of other themes. \\n\\n When a player marks the third box on the upgrade track of a theme, that theme immediately gains an upgrade. The player then clears all three boxes, resetting that upgrade track to zero. When a theme gains an upgrade, it becomes better than it was before, usually in the form of a new power tag or a new theme Special, making the theme more powerful and versatile. \\n MARKING UPGRADE BOXES \\n\\n There are a number of ways in which a player can mark an upgrade box on a theme. • Invoke weakness tags: When the player or the MC in- vokes one of the PC’s weakness tags when counting tags (assuming the MC agrees that is it relevant), the player marks one upgrade box on the theme to which the weakness tag belongs. This occurs regardless of the result of the roll. • Downtime: During downtime (page 124), a player can select an activity that will allow them to mark an upgrade box on one of their themes. • Hard choices: When a PC sacrifices something of impor- tance to abide by their motivations (uphold an Identity, complete a Ritual, or scratch an Itch), especially if what they sacrifice leads them to mark Decay on another theme, they may mark an upgrade box on the theme for which they sacrificed. • Specials: Some theme Specials and even Challenge Specials may allow the PC to mark an upgrade box. These custom rules detail when they apply and to which themes. When a player marks all three boxes on a theme’s upgrade track and earns an upgrade for that theme, they may choose it from the following options. \\n CREATE A NEW POWER TAG \\n\\n Add a new power tag to the theme. • For characters created with Rapid Character Creation (page 177), choose one of the power tags you did not yet choose from the same theme kit. • For characters created with Custom Character Creation (page 190), answer one of the power tag questions that you did not previously answer from the same themebook. The answer becomes your new power tag. • For pregens, choose a new power tag that has an empty checkbox next to it and check that box. You now possess this power tag as part of that theme. \\n ADD, REWRITE, OR REMOVE A WEAKNESS TAG \\n\\n Add a new weakness tag to the theme that gained the up- grade. This allows you more opportunities to mark upgrades on this theme, accelerating the rate of gaining upgrades, as well as give more depth to your character. • For characters created with Rapid Character Creation (page 177), choose one of the weakness tags you did not yet choose from the same theme kit. • For characters created with Custom Character Creation (page 190), answer one of the weakness tag questions that you did not previously answer from the same themebook. The answer becomes your new weakness tag. • New weakness tags suggestions are not available for pregens, but you may come up with a new weakness tag on the fly instead. You may also use this upgrade to rewrite or update a weak- ness tag. Perhaps something changed in your character, and they are dealing with different difficulties. Finally, you can use this upgrade to remove a weakness tag if your character no longer suffers from this limitation. Be aware, however, that this may limit or slow the rate of marking upgrades on this theme. \\n CHOOSE A THEME SPECIAL \\n\\n Theme Specials offer special benefits and rules that boost the theme or actions that use tags from that theme. As an upgrade, you may select any theme Special that is available for your theme. You can only choose each theme Special once. \\n\\n Chracter & Crew Evolution \\n • Theme accomplishment: When a PC achieves a significant narrative goal that is defined by one of their motivations, e.g., they completed the Ritual “You must summon the archdemon Asmodeus” by summoning the demon, the MC can offer them to mark an upgrade box on the theme as a reward. \\n CHOOSING UPGRADES \\n\\n | \\n\\n 133 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n • Each theme type has five base Specials, listed under its respective themebook (starting on page 196). This applies even if you made your theme from a theme kit (Rapid Character Creation, page 177). • Some theme kits found in expansion books offer their own theme Specials, in addition to the five granted by the theme type. Only a theme based on that theme kit can gain that Special. \\n RESET DECAY \\n\\n Decay is gained on themes whenever you go against your Identity, Ritual, or Itch. You may spend an upgrade to re- move all Decay from the theme you are upgrading. This represents your character getting back to what “matters’’ and giving the theme all the attention it deserves, and thus keeping it from decaying. \\n MARK EVOLUTION \\n\\n As an upgrade, you can mark Evolution on your character card to indicate something is happening to your character, something big, that has still not come to light. Evolution builds up to a big transformation or enhancement to your character, see under Evolution (page 140). \\n CREW THEME UPGRADES \\n\\n The crew theme gains marks on upgrade boxes in similar ways to a PC’s theme: when a crew weakness tag is invoked, when a crew relationship tag is invoked as a weakness tag, when a PC spends their downtime giving attention to the crew, when a PC sacrifices something for the crew motivation, when the crew achieves a major goal closely related to their crew theme, or as part of a Special. A crew theme upgrade can be spent on the same things as a character theme upgrade, except for marking Evolution – crews do not gain Evolution points. \\n LOADOUT THEME UPGRADES \\n\\n When the loadout theme upgrade track is full, the theme upgrade can be spent on one of the following options. Each option may be selected multiple times. • Gain a permanent +1 Power when Loading Up. • Choose a new Loadout Theme Special (page 253). \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Loadout themes normally mark an upgrade box when one of their loadout flaw tags is invoked. \\n\\n 134 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " 'ESSENCE': 'ESSENCE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The balance of Self, Mythos, and Noise in a character determines what they are in essence. For example, a character with several Noise themes has a significant part of themselves dedicated to one or more technological instruments. A character with a single Mythos theme is in constant contact with a supernatural force, but isn’t fully invested in it. \\n\\n Starting at the beginning of the game, each character’s Essence is defined by their Self-Mythos-Noise balance. As PCs transform and replace their themes, that balance may change, also altering the character’s Essence. In other words, the PC’s essential nature changes and they become something different. The more extreme their choices, pull- ing toward one aspect while sacrificing others, the more unusual and radical their new Essence is. In general, the more Self, Mythos, or Noise themes a PC has, the more aware they become in that domain and the harder it is to tamper with their abilities in that domain. This is represented by the player’s option to Roll With Self, Mythos, or Noise (page 122). In addition, a PC always has one Essence Special, a special ability (similar to a theme Special) which stems from their current essential state and theme balance. It is noted on the character card. The section below also includes advice for the MC on how to handle each type of character in a series. \\n NEXUS (ALL THREE TYPES) \\n\\n You have touched on the full gamut of experiences which living in this age can offer. As such, you adapt to change faster than others. When you next replace a theme, if you’re still a Nexus after the transformation, it starts as a full theme, not a nascent one. For the MC: A Nexus PC has not committed to a specific path and is playing the field. As such, you should periodically challenge their motivations, cycling between Self, Mythos, and Noise to see what gives. This will reveal whether the Nexus is just a phase on the way to something else or truly a chosen lifestyle, a form of a Jack of All Trades. \\n SPIRITUALIST (SELF AND MYTHOS) \\n\\n You have shunned technology or at least kept it from en- croaching on your soul, valuing above all the human spirit and its connection to the mystery of the mythical. Once per session, you can tap this bond to add your Mythos to the Power of an action that is primarily powered by Self themes, or add your Self to an action that is primarily powered by Mythos themes, or, if you are already rolling with Mythos or with Self, roll with both (Power of 4). For the MC: A Spiritualist PC is plumbing the depths of the human mystery against the contrast of technology. Include ample opportunities for the PC to triumph over tech and the maladies of the postmodern world, as well as to commune with that which is sacred within human beings, whether through relationships with others or relationships with invisible, higher, or deeper forces. On the flip side, tempt them with tech that could solve their problems. \\n CYBORG (SELF AND NOISE) TRANSHUMAN (MYTHOS AND NOISE) \\n\\n In your search for the edge of what is possible through magic and tech, you’ve abandoned all semblance of humanity – or perhaps you had none to begin with. Experimenting with the paradoxical marriage of legend and cyber is the ulti- mate expression of your being. Once per scene, when you invoke both mythical and technological tags in the same action, no matter their source, you can trade a miss (6 or less) outcome with a mixed hit (7-9). For the MC: A Transhuman character explores the strange place where Mythos and Noise meet. Come up with some weird theories about the nature of that meeting point and create jobs or other opportunities for the PC to venture into deep cyberspace, where it crosses over to the Otherscape. \\n REAL (ONLY SELF) \\n\\n In a world beleaguered by temptations to become more, you have chosen to remain yourself, eschewing fancy baubles and the pull of past narratives. Whether you did so out of stubbornness, lack of vision, or something far deeper, you are who you are, and no outside force – mythical or tech- nological – can say otherwise. Whenever you take action to directly uphold or protect one of your Identities, you may roll with Self instead of counting positive tags. For the MC: A PC who has gone Real has chosen (or slipped into) a defiance of all foreign influences on their person, whether technological or mythical. They have de- cided, in one way or another, that to engage with mystical or technological ascendancy is to sell out what it is to be themselves. The question becomes, can they survive against such superhuman powers? Is being “just human” enough? Use your Challenges to push this point so the PC’s strength of conviction can truly shine. Note this PC is already highly resistant to any attempt to alter who they are (see Rolling With Self, Mythos, or Noise, page 122). \\n\\n Chracter & Crew Evolution \\n You are flesh, wires, and data, celebrating the freedom of the digital universe or moving to gain full control over the material world, paying no heed to this new and incalculable “magic” – a bump on the road of humanity’s nonstop technological progress. You can add your number of Self or Noise to the Power of any action to resist or shake off mythical forces that are not manifested as tangible or measurable effects, such as curses, hallucinations, or mental influences. You may do this once per session with your Self and once per session with your Noise, or you may use both in the same action. For the MC: A Cyborg PC symbolizes the triumph of human ingenuity over the monsters and gods, over the traditional, and over humanity’s haunted past. Provide opportunities for the PC to confront and overcome mythical adversaries and their “impossible” forms of attack. At the same time, challenge the limits of what their technology can do in the face of primordial forces like nature, spirit, and fate. \\n | \\n\\n 135 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n AVATAR (ONLY MYTHOS, SAME SOURCE) \\n\\n You and your Source have become one. Now, you are a Source unto yourself, a beacon of your legend on earth. Suspend all your Rituals; instead, choose an Agenda, which, if ever ignored (defied even once), would instantly cause you to replace all of your themes (your new themes may not include Mythos themes of your lost Source). While you are an Avatar, you may instantly recover burned power tags. For the MC: An Avatar PC is on a power trip. On the one hand, you should let them take it as far as they can, even if it means ripping through a job or two, or redefining the political landscape in the Megacity. On the other hand, you should constantly challenge their loyalty to their Agenda to keep this power trip short and sweet, perhaps even en- listing the other PCs to stop their rampant crew member. \\n CONDUIT (ONLY MYTHOS, DIFFERENT SOURCES) \\n\\n You are no longer a person; you have given yourself up to become a vessel for mythical forces, sacred and unspeak- able, harmonizing and clashing within you. You may replace themes at will as long as you replace them with a Mythos theme. Any Source in your possession or even nearby can become your new Mythos theme and it begins as a full theme, not a nascent one. For the MC: A PC who is a Conduit is all about exper- imenting with how different legends and mythologies create synergies and conflicts. Keep your scenes stocked with interesting Sources for them to absorb and engage with and use symbolic thinking to figure out how these Mythoi interact with one another. You are a new life form. You have left humanity and its blathering stories behind, venturing into an existence of pure informational truth, beyond the illusion of meaning. Psychological effects and intangible or unmeasurable myth- ical effects do not affect you. You can interface with ALL information, regardless of medium, and may roll with Noise to search it and, if it is recorded information, to manipulate it. For the MC: A PC who is a Singularity explores ideas about transcending humanity through technology. Go wild and push the boundaries of what ‘information’ means here – the universe itself could be a matrix of information, or a simulation, or a supercomputer, and the PC is tapping into this new and unexplored layer of reality, and can also manipulate it. \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n SINGULARITY (ONLY NOISE) \\n\\n 136 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " 'THEMATIC TRANSFORMATIONS': 'THEMATIC TRANSFORMATIONS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Your character’s motivations – their Identities, Rituals, and Itches – define what matters to them. These are the driving forces within them, but much like in a real person, sometimes fundamental beliefs and touchstones change. Over time we outgrow our occupations, or find that some relationships begin to splinter. These moments are scary and destabilizing, but offer a huge opportunity to become better and evolve. \\n\\n MARKING DECAY \\n\\n The process of transformation in a player character begins with marking Decay on one of their themes’ Decay track. A player may choose to mark Decay whenever their PC is acting against the motivation of that theme: • For Self themes, when the PC takes an action in a way that goes against one of their Identities or fails to take action to uphold that Identity. • For Mythos themes, when the PC fails to perform the Ritual that connects them to their Source. • For Noise themes, when the PC stifles or avoids scratch- ing their technological Itch, that is, when they do not surrender to its impulse. Marking Decay signifies that the theme’s importance in the life of the character is waning or at risk. Once is fine, but three times is a pattern. For example: • You ignore a request of assistance from your gang (an Affiliation theme with the Identity I’m here for my gang). Maybe you’re just too busy, maybe you’re angry or dis- appointed and are turning over a new leaf. • You choose to hide away instead of taking your usual leadership role (a Personality theme with the Identity My place is at the center). Maybe you’re disguising yourself as someone else, maybe you’re tired of leading, or perhaps you want to give someone else an opportunity to shine. • You avoid using your chainsaw arm (a Cutting Edge theme with the Itch Chop it up!). Maybe it’s not suitable for this stealth mission (it’s big and loud) or you no longer feel the rage that you felt when you first installed it; perhaps now you want to build. \\n FOR THE MC: PRESENTING HARD CHOICES \\n\\n As the MC, you can help your players evolve their characters in interesting ways by presenting them with hard choices. A hard choice is a choice between two motivations or between a motivation and the objectives of a job. For example: • Ritual vs. Identity: To complete a Ritual, a PC must sac- rifice a lot of their wealth (Identity). They must choose whether they pay the price, or keep their money. • Itch vs. Ritual: A PC’s demonic companion wants to feed off a dying man’s spirit (Ritual), but their medical cyberware Itches to heal and save that individual. • Identity vs. Itch: A PC’s son asked them not to track him online. They must choose between their need to track everyone (Itch) and their trusting relationship with their son (Identity). • Ritual vs. objective: A PC’s Mythos deems that they must never take a life, but their crew undertook the assassination of a vile arms dealer, and the PC is placed in a situation where they are the only one that can take the killing shot. • Identity vs. objective: The PC can steal only one piece of information before disconnecting from a hostile domain: a name vital for their crew’s job or the where- abouts of their long-lost sister (Identity). Crafting hard choices isn’t always easy; it’s a skill you can hone over time. If you haven’t tried your hand in design- ing such hard choices for character development before, you should first know that not every hard choice you design succeeds in leading the PC to a dramatic moment. Sometimes it’s about execution, delivery, or finding the right moment; other times, everything goes according to plan but the player doesn’t ‘bite’ because that’s not a choice that they want to pursue for their PC. At the end of the day, it’s up to the player to decide what constitutes a hard choice for their character – you are only there to provide them with opportunities. Start developing this skill by reading your crew’s motiva- tions before the session and choosing one character to focus on, choosing a different PC every session. Choose which of their motivations to challenge and design scenes and events that could potentially make them forgo these motivations, or put them into question. During the session, steer things gently in the direction of the hard choice you planned and make it happen if you get the chance, but don’t force the situation. Remember, only a choice between two good things or two bad things matters. There must be a price to pay, otherwise the PC will likely choose to uphold their motivation, because it’s an easy choice. The most reliable kind of price to pitch is failing to uphold a different motivation, or failing to complete an objective vital to their job, as explained above. Once you are comfortable with designing hard choices, you can attempt to gradually increase their frequency or to try posing such hard choices for multiple PCs in each session. \\n\\n Chracter & Crew Evolution \\n • Itch vs. objective: A mob of enraged rioters is accosting the crew. While a PC could stop the mob by taking the po- dium and giving a speech, their camouflage suit beckons them to turn it on and slip away unnoticed (Itch). • You miss your daily communing with the spirit of Horus at dawn, as the Eye of Ra commands (an Artifact theme with the Ritual I must consult with Horus every sunrise). It could be that you’ve lost faith in Horus’ divinity and righteousness, or that you’re trapped and have no idea when sunrise is. \\n | \\n\\n 137 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n REPLACING A THEME \\n\\n When a player marks the third Decay box on a theme, it is removed and replaced by a new theme. All of the replaced theme’s features, including power tags, weakness tags, theme Specials, motivations, and so on are removed and cease to be a part of the PC, no longer available to the player. When a theme is replaced, follow these steps. \\n STEP 1: LOSE THE THEME \\n\\n Losing a theme represents an aspect of the PC that is lost, ignored, or put on the back burner. It could mean that the PC no longer has any Affiliation with their former gang, that they no longer possess the same Assets as before, that they have forgotten or lost access to their Esoterica knowledge, that their Augmentation has been destroyed or taken from them, and so on. It could also mean that the PC still possesses the same aspects but that they choose not to use them or that these aspects no longer take center stage in their lives. Whatever the narrative explanation, the effect is identical: the PC no longer has these tags, and therefore cannot derive Power from them. \\n STEP 2: GAIN EVOLUTION POINTS \\n\\n Next, the player marks a number of Evolution points on their character card based on the theme they just replaced: Unagi has just marked the third Decay on her Horizon theme. When she replaces her theme, she gains one point of Evolution immediately, then she looks at what else she has improved on this theme. She’s added a fourth power tag on it, and a second weakness tag. As such, she gains two extra points of Evolution. She has no theme Specials on this theme, so no extra points there. This was the first ever theme she re- placed, so she now has three points of Evolution, and needs two more in order to have her first Moment of Evolution. Evolution points can also be gained as an upgrade (Choosing Upgrades, page 133). \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n • One Evolution point for losing a theme, regardless of its content • One Evolution point for every power tag in the replaced theme beyond the first three • One Evolution point for every weakness tag in the replaced theme beyond the first one • One Evolution point for every theme Special in the replaced theme When a player has marked 5 Evolution on their Evolution track, they gain a Moment of Evolution (page 140). \\n\\n 138 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n STEP 3: CREATE A NEW THEME \\n\\n The player now creates a new nascent theme to replace the lost theme. This could occur immediately after losing a theme or after a while, when the player has had time to consider what new aspect is on the rise in the PC’s life. A nascent theme represents a new force in the PC’s life that has taken root in the wake of the replaced theme. For example: • A PC who has lost a loved one (Affiliation) drowns their despair in the study of arcane rituals (Esoterica) • A PC swaps a Source that allows them to summon a Japanese yōkai (Companion) for one that allows them to become one (Exposure) • A PC decides to stop being Mr. Nice Guy (Personality) and installs a minigun in their cyberarm (Augmentation) The player may use Rapid or Custom character creation (page 174) to create the new theme, which could be of any type, including the one that was just lost. However, for more dramatic character transformations, players should pick a theme type that isn’t in the same category (Self, Mythos, Noise) as the theme they have just lost. A nascent theme is similar in every respect to a full theme, with the exception that it has one power tag only – the title tag – instead of three power tags; it has a weakness tag and a motivation as usual. Going forward, whenever a player would mark an upgrade box on a nascent theme, they instead choose a new power tag. Once the theme has three power tags, it becomes a regular theme and the player may begin to mark upgrade boxes as normal. \\n STEP 4: EVOLVE THE CHARACTER’S ESSENCE \\n\\n After a theme has been replaced, the balance of Self- Mythos-Noise in the character may have changed, thus changing their Essence (page 134). The character loses their former Essence Special and gains a new one based on their new Self-Mythos-Noise balance. This often indicates a deeper transformation in the character on the narrative level. A Nexus could choose to forgo their Mythos and turn into a Cyborg, or a Conduit could open up to their humanity (Self) again and become a Spiritualist. \\n STEP 5: GHOST MEMORIES \\n\\n Nothing ever goes quietly into the good night, and when major life themes are abandoned, the shit hits the fan. Even if your departure from the theme was on peaceful terms, this is still a good opportunity for you and the MC to create interesting story developments around the theme that was replaced. Maybe you’re forced to confront your past and move on from it. Perhaps you’ve realized what part of you is holding you back and you need to take steps to truly transform into something new. Consult with the MC and take the time on screen to process what has happened. Think about any ricochets or fallout from giving up on your dreams, loss of mystical powers, or finally kick- ing your tech addiction. In the cyberpunk genre, these personal moments are key to exploring the transhuman thematic elements of the sto- ry. This scene is about you, as you transform by giving up on what came before and explore what your identity really is. What does it mean to be human, AI, or cyborg? What does it mean to serve a god in the age of information? Now, faced with the consequences of your choices, is the time to answer these questions. \\n\\n Chracter & Crew Evolution \\n | \\n\\n 139 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield.

       " 'EVOLUTION': 'EVOLUTION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Throughout the ebb and flow of a character’s life, their triumphs and their falls, something else is happening within them. \\n\\n Whether it’s accumulated experience, strength of charac- ter, or just pure badassery, they are gradually becoming something more. They evolve. \\n EVOLUTION POINTS \\n\\n Evolution points build up toward a dramatic change in your character. When playing a series, each character has a character card with an Evolution track that has five circles, representing five Evolution points. As you gain Evolution points, nothing changes about your character externally, but there is a growing sense of a big change coming. You may gain Evolution points: • As a theme upgrade (Mark Evolution, page 134) • When replacing a theme (Gain Evolution Points, page 138) When all five circles in a PC’s Evolution track are marked, the character gains a Moment of Evolution. The track is then reset to zero, and any remaining Evolution points are marked as usual. For example, if a character had 3 Evolution points and gained another 3 Evolution points, they would mark two Evolution points to fill up the track, gain a Moment of Evolution and reset the track, and then mark the one remaining Evolution point. \\n MOMENTS OF EVOLUTION \\n\\n When you gain a Moment of Evolution, you can choose it from the list below, also given on the PC’s character card. You may only choose each Moment of Evolution once. ⬜ Create a new type of Essence ⬜ Create another broad power tag ⬜ Gain a Veteran Special ⬜ Gain a Veteran Special ⬜ Gain a Veteran Special ⬜ Ride off into the sunset (Retirement) ⬜ Sunder the cosmology (Narrative development) ⬜ Total Reconstitution (Respec) \\n | \\n\\n 2 // P L A Y - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n A Moment of Evolution goes beyond growth or change. It allows a player to rethink what they already have, to reflect how much their character developed since the beginning, or to really transform the character (sometimes literally) into something new. \\n\\n 140 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n CREATE A NEW TYPE OF ESSENCE \\n\\n As your character evolves into something new, perhaps they no longer fit into the definitions of Nexus, Spiritualist, Cyborg, Transhuman, Real, Avatar, Conduit, or Singularity. You and the MC create a new type of Essence that befits your character, their story, and what they have become, and furnish it with its own Essence Special (you can take inspiration from the existing Essence Specials on page 134). Going forward, this new type of Essence is a part of your series and can be chosen by other PCs who meet the requirements, whether it is a specific balance of Self- Mythos-Noise or some other narrative situation. \\n CREATE ANOTHER BROAD POWER TAG \\n\\n As explained under Specific, Broad, & Too Broad Tags (page 192), broad power tags are tags that are applicable in many situations. They are incredibly generic and practical, and therefore powerful. Each character is only allowed one, but with this Evolution you can create a second one. Create a new broad tag for one of your themes as you would when gaining an upgrade. If you lose this theme in the future, you may answer one of the questions of the replacement themebook with a broad power tag. PCs should never have more than two broad power tags. \\n GAIN A VETERAN SPECIAL \\n\\n Some things can only be learned through hard-earned experience, and there are levels of badassery that are only obtainable to those who have been to hell and back. These incredible skills are represented by Veteran Specials. Choose one Veteran Special to gain from the following list. You may find additional Veteran Specials to choose from in :Otherscape supplements. ⬜ Backpack Beast: Wildcard loadout tags costs you 1 Power instead of 2 (in other words, you can spend all your Loading Up Power on wildcards, and activate your loadout tags during the job rather than when Loading Up). ⬜ Backup Clones: When you take a status that exceeds your Limit (usually tier-6), you may remove it at the beginning of the next scene. The second time you wish to do so, you may remove it at the end of the next downtime. The third time you wish to do so, you may remove it at the end of the job. Then remove this Special. ⬜ Customizable Gear: Once per scene, you can burn any loadout tag and recover another. ⬜ Experienced Efficiency: Once per session, if you choose the Power benefit during downtime, you may gain 5 Power to spend instead of 3. ⬜ God-Slayer: You can ignore a Scale gap of up to 3 in one type of interaction (combat, social, magical, etc.) chosen with the MC when you select this Special. ⬜ Interfacer: Whenever you encounter tech for the first time, you immediately learn one useful detail about it. When you encounter anything related to that tech later, you immediately recognize it. ⬜ Larger Than Life: You can ignore a Scale gap of 1 in all actions. ⬜ Level Up Your Game: Choose 7 upgrades across all your themes. ⬜ Not My First Rodeo: Once per session, you can trade a miss (6 or less) for a mixed hit (7-9), as long as you didn’t roll snake eyes. ⬜ Saw That Coming: Once per session, when the MC delivers Consequences or activates a Challenge’s Spe- cial, you may treat them as a Threat and then take the spotlight and take a single (additional) action, which can address or even nullify that Threat. ⬜ Slow & Steady: From now on, the upgrade track on all of your themes has 5 boxes instead of 3. Whenever you mark the 5th upgrade box on a theme, you gain two upgrades and reset your upgrade track. ⬜ Source-Sensitive: Whenever you encounter a Source for the first time, you immediately learn one useful detail about its Mythos. When you encounter anything related to that Mythos later, you immediately recog- nize it. ⬜ The Harder You Fall: When one of your weakness tags is invoked (regardless of who invoked it), you may choose to lose 2 Power instead of one and mark 2 upgrade boxes. ⬜ Willpower Over Chance: You no longer automatically miss when you roll snake eyes. \\n RIDE OFF INTO THE SUNSET SUNDER THE COSMOLOGY \\n\\n You make a discovery, change the world, or transform in a way that redefines the series. Perhaps you discover ex- traterrestrial life or technology, or if these already exist in your series, become the first human-alien hybrid. Perhaps you discover the world is a simulation and that the Mythoi are rogue programs trying to awaken humanity from their cybernetic dream. Or your freedom fighting faction lands a resounding victory over the corporations, starting the first corporate-free Megacity, with all the responsibilities and complications involved. Discuss your desired changes with the MC and work together with her to integrate them into your series. \\n TOTAL RECONSTITUTION \\n\\n Your character ceases to be what it once was and becomes something completely new. This is not a partial change, like replacing one theme; all of your character’s themes are replaced at the same time, and any outcome is possible. Perhaps they died in a firefight and their entire body is being replaced with augmentations, while their psyche is uploaded to cyberspace. Or maybe they were chosen as the Avatar of the Phoenix, consumed in the flames and reborn. They could pull off a complete personality, body, and digital records restructure and start a new life in a new Megacity unbeknownst to anyone else. When you respec your character, you create four new themes, like a new character. In addition, based on the old character’s makeup, the new character gains: • A free upgrade for every power tag in any theme above the first three • A free upgrade for every weakness tag in any theme above the first one • A free upgrade for every theme Special in any theme • All of the old character’s Evolution points • All of the old character’s Moments of Evolution Each free theme upgrade can be used as explained under Choosing Upgrades (page 133) on any of the new char- acter’s themes. Moments of Evolution that are attached to a theme can be reassigned to any of the new themes. \\n\\n Chracter & Crew Evolution \\n Your character has had enough and it’s time to say goodbye. You choose the terms of their retirement. Maybe they are killed off in a heroic way, or have the last laugh, or die a completely wasteful and unnecessary death. Maybe they escape to live a life of solitude in the wilderness or join a hidden hippie arcology, never to be seen again. Perhaps they start a family and give up life as a merc or an op- erative. They could become wealthy beyond belief, copy themselves into cyberspace, or ascend to the Otherscape and become a Mythos. Whatever you choose, your PC leaves the series, at least as a lead character. Time to make a new character! At your option and with the MC’s approval, your new PC could start with the same number of upgrades and Evolution points as the retired character; follow the rules under Total Reconstitution below. \\n | \\n\\n 141 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

It’s intended for use by MCs and players alike, including everyone in constructing the fundamentals of your game. \\n SERIES SETUP \\n\\n This section takes you through all of the steps you need to create your game, from series concept, through crew theme, Megacity design, character creation, and finally running the introductory “A Night in the Megacity” scene. \\n THE MEGACITY GENERATOR \\n\\n A complete system for generating a playable Megacity and its districts, from its weird Mythos influences, to its cybered-up industrial accidents, to its corruption and warfare. Think of it as a randomized dystopia generator you can use to turn any modern or imaginary city into something just detailed enough to serve as a backdrop for your :Otherscape stories. \\n CHARACTER CREATION \\n\\n Make your character step-by-step. You can choose from common mythic and cyberpunk tropes to collect prepared theme kits, lists of ready-to-play tags, or go deeper into the details and answer questionnaires called themebooks to create your character from scratch. Themebooks and theme kits are organized into Self, Mythos, and Noise. Here you’ll find an extensive catalog of loadout gear for your characters. Each entry represents an item for sale over the counter or on the black market, or some kind of access or info. Items include general descriptions for how they are used as well as a set of tags you can choose to create as story tags or to add to your loadout theme. \\n\\n | 3 // C R E A T E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n LOADOUT: STREET CATALOG \\n\\n 144 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

Custom options are marked with . If you want full control over the details, you can instead go Custom, answering questions to come up with tags for your crew, generating a Megacity with a random generator mini-game, and cre- ating personally-tailored characters. Note that Custom, obviously, takes longer than Rapid. You can mix and match the two approaches for different elements of your series. For example, you can pick a pre- made Megacity to play in, but create custom characters.

       " 'CHOOSE A SERIES CONCEPT -  - Limited ACCESS': 'CHOOSE A SERIES CONCEPT\\n\\n\\nLimited ACCESS\\n\\n\\n Begin your series setup by discussing the high concept for the series, using the baseline aspects of the :Otherscape universe described in Chapter 1: //Imagine and the following questions. You’ll decide the specifics by following the next steps, but first, you all should have some agreements on the basics. \\n\\n The three questions that will most help you define your series are: \\n WHAT ARE YOUR GAME’S CENTRAL THEMES? \\n\\n • Is there a moral subject or an aspect of human behav- ior you want to explore? • Is there a specific technological breakthrough at the heart of this game, such as cloning? • Are there specific mythologies or legends that will be the focus of this series? \\n WHAT IS YOUR CREW CONCEPT? \\n\\n • What kind of people are the protagonists and what brings them together? • What kind of missions do you usually go on? What kinds of enemies do you face? \\n WHAT IS YOUR MEGACITY LIKE? \\n\\n All :Otherscape games are of course set within the cyberpunk genre, focused on cinematic action, but it’s worth discussing exactly what elements of :Otherscape you want to explore in your game. Chapter 1: //Imagine presented the main thematic pillars of :Otherscape games (page 18). Here they are again, with ideas about how they might impact your series concept. MYTHOLOGY WEAPONIZED is the most central theme of :Otherscape, so it should be core to your game as well. The crew is going to have magic and encounter it in the hands of foes or out in the wild, with everyone taking advantage of it to the best of their abilities. The use of such entities and forces has repercussions, and you should decide how far they go. \\n | \\n\\n 3 // C R E A T E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n DISCUSSING CENTRAL THEMES \\n\\n 146 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n TECHNOLOGICAL OVERDRIVE, MORAL BANKRUPTCY. A se- ries that explores these elements of cyberpunk is all about showcasing technologies that take over human activities, integrated into every aspect of life, providing incredible benefits to a select few. The city is full of poor, brainwashed, and powerless masses. The power players care only about the bottom line, labor and lives are cheap and expendable and therefore people are a common collateral damage. OLIGARCHIC CORRUPTION. Corporations and the suits who run them are common antagonists, but in a game that focuses on this theme, you’ll expose (and exploit) the inner politics of a corp. Your series could be an investigation into this kind of evil, along the line between government, crime, community, and corp, or it could simply feature or- ganizations that aren’t just huge monoliths, but are made of individuals with conflicting agendas. CITIES IN RUINS. If your group is into some serious explora- tion, scavenging, and monster fighting, go into the ruins. The outskirts of the Megacity and the underground layers that it was built upon are both full of interesting encounters, strange individuals, discarded tech, not to mention the kinds of places and objects that could prove to be fertile ground for Sources. SPRAWLING CYBERSPACE. Cyberspace is everywhere, but a game that focuses on this theme can really push into the idea of a layered reality in which everything is connected. What’s “real” becomes unclear, as almost anything can change its appearance. Thanks to Harnessing, crews can spend entire adventures or even entire lives online, either crashing through corp Domains or exploring the neglected and secret areas in and beyond the Tangle. GANGS, CULTS, & COUNTERCULTURE. When a series focuses on these topics, it’s all about contrasts. Gangs that are small fish in the big scheme, but kings and queens of their turfs. Cults with bizarre motivations and practices, whose members present themselves as completely normative. Strange subcultures one needs to delve deep into, and then go back to the “normal” world, perhaps forever changed. All of these combined showcase the unknowable melting pot culture that a true Megacity can offer. TRANSHUMANISM. This sort of series features big picture ideas that throw into doubt the fundamental ideas we all take for granted. New technologies raise questions of identity, memories, community, morality, and humanity. Adversaries might be built around extreme transhuman ideals, tempting the PCs to cross over into a new type of existence. PCs probably carry Noise themes which serve as a platform for futuristic interpretations of modern concepts. \\n SAFETY TOOLS \\n\\n Transhumanist science fiction stories, such as those you might tell with your :Otherscape games, can feature plots about how we define ourselves, our species, and our lives. They explore logical extremes, showcasing the negative effects of policies, technologies, and societal trends. This can chal- lenge the sensibilities of even the most open minded of us. What’s more, the aesthetic of the cyberpunk genre features extreme poverty and income inequality, gang violence, drug abuse, and quite a lot of issues around disability and its inter- action with technology. Additionally, the general concept of a dystopia can be a bit of a burden for some players. Stories about abusive government policies, ruthless corporate greed, and the inevitable consequences of human-induced climate change and pollution will naturally arise in cyberpunk. Some areas that could become problematic include: • The nature of humanity and inhumanity • Identity, including sense of self, ideas about gender and sexuality, or any other self-conception • Loss of player or character agency in a scene • Graphic violence • Mental health • Poverty and inequality • Ethnic gangs (which could be considered racist depictions) • Disabilities and the disabled You’re going to want to figure out which of these topics are a problem for members of your play group. We suggest the Lines & Veils safety tool, which includes means for players to indicate what they’re not really on board for, both before the game starts and during play. A line is a hard line that a player does not want crossed; a topic or scenario they don’t want mentioned in passing and certainly not showcased in the story. A veil is a limit that is softer, which is to say that the player would rather that the topic or scenario not be described in detail or included in a scene, but its inclusion in the setting is alright. Go over your lines and veils as a group during the series setup, but always remember it’s perfectly fine and even expected for someone to add or subtract from the list during \\n CREW CONCEPT \\n\\n The basic premise of an :Otherscape game revolves around the crew. A crew is a group of player characters who work together, doing jobs for a set employer or for whoever will hire them. They are usually up-and-comers in the Megac- ity, and many would be described as mercenaries. Money, prestige, and the opportunity to advance in the world is paramount to them, though it’s possible for a crew to form around a particular common interest or cause. Motive matters most, and it’s important for everyone to buy into the concept of the series, so be sure to go over the options and come to a consensus on what the crew will be about. It’s possible to occasionally have jobs with a different theme, and over time the entire premise might change, but what you decide to initially work towards will have a big impact on who you come up with as characters, so this is a big decision. For example, if you decide to be a group of outcasts and rejects living in the forsaken and derelict parts of the Megacity and surviving against mutants and monstrosities in the pollu- tion-devastated wastelands, then this is what your series will be about, for the most part. You won’t be regularly hired by high-flying officials to silence their political opposition, not because it’s impossible (this could actually be the subject of an interesting job or story arc) but because this is not the focus of your game. On the other hand, if you are a team of hitmen then assassinating political targets may be your bread-and-butter activity, and you’ll rarely see outer wilds. The MC might already have their own concept for a series, but this is a conversation with gives and takes – talk among yourselves to find out a good combination of a crew you’re excited to play as, and a concept you’re excited to explore. Brainstorm some ideas and discuss them. Ask each other questions about each idea to develop it. We suggest you begin with the crew concepts presented below, based on the types of crews introduced on page 37. Assume that all the player characters already know each other, at least tangentially. While you might not be a united team just yet, you should at least be willing to work together and agree upon a general way of doing things, at least at the start. Once the game begins, anything can happen. \\n\\n Series Setup \\n For example, Henry has a serious problem with the inclusion of sexual violence and harm to children. He might also get easily creeped out by in-depth descriptions of mental illness and drug abuse. The first set would be something he’d in- dicate as lines for him and the latter perhaps simply veils since they’re more about graphic depiction than an actual problem with them being included in the setting and story. play. Henry could decide that actually mental illness scenes are more of a line for him than just a veil and he’d rather not encounter the topic during play. People can always change their mind. A recent experience or change of heart could easily have altered what they’d rather or rather not encounter during a game that’s intended to be fun. \\n | \\n\\n 147 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " 'CHOOSE A SERIES CONCEPT': 'CHOOSE A SERIES CONCEPT\\n\\n\\nWITHOUT A CREW \\n\\n The working assumption in :Otherscape is that charac- ters start the game already knowing each other, having a good understanding of how to work together, and sharing a common cause. Without this assumption, you can have no crew theme; and without that theme, there’s no single coherent motivation to keep the game focused on the series concept you’ve developed. If you want to tell the story of how the crew came together, we recommend doing so retroactively. Follow the usual series setup steps, and when you’re ready to play, have some flashbacks to show how it came to be that this group of people became a crew. \\n EXAMPLE SERIES CONCEPTS \\n\\n Here are some example series concepts based on the crew tropes presented in Chapter 1: //Imagine (page 37): \\n ALL-AROUND FIXERS \\n\\n Hired as problem solvers to the Megacity’s elite, you are the all-purpose troubleshooters who get called in when things go from bad to worse.

       " 'CHOOSE YOUR MEGACITY -  - STARTING WITHOUT A CREW': 'CHOOSE YOUR MEGACITY\\n\\n\\nSTARTING WITHOUT A CREW\\n\\n\\n Now that you know what your crew is all about, at least in broad strokes, it’s time to turn your attention to the setting and environment of your series. \\n\\n Most :Otherscape series are set in a Megacity setting, whether one or multiple, thriving, ruined, or both. Your series can focus on one Megacity or start in one and then continue in another as your story unfolds. Alternatively, it could be a globetrotting adventure where you never sleep in the same Megacity twice, or even go into orbit and beyond. The Megacity you play in as well as its future history are cre- ated by your group. Choose one of these creation methods: • Pick a premade Megacity profile from the list on the following page. Each comes with its own districts and developments, turmoils, and troubles. • Use the Megacity Generator (page 160) together, MC and players, to make sure your Megacity fits the kinds of stories you all want to play. This is the most time-con- suming but, for many, also the most satisfying option. • Have the MC generate the Megacity. If your group already has a solid grasp of your concept even before the series setup, the MC can use the Megacity Generator by herself to create a custom-made setting that fits the game you want to play. This leaves session zero to focus on crew and character creation. • Grab a Megacity supplement book such as Tokyo:Other- scape, which includes premade setting information, key player operations, Challenges, jobs, and player options, all tailored to a specific Megacity and inspired by its prevailing culture. The Megacity gives context for your crew and your character. They can come from a war-torn district, be a survivor of the city-wide plague, or reside in a ruined part of an old arcology. options, all tailored to a specific Megacity and inspired by its prevailing culture. \\n\\n Series Setup \\n Typical Jobs: tense negotiations with the hunters, escape into the sewers or outlands, searching for a safehouse, violent merc job, new identity purchasing in cyberspace \\n SERIES – STEP 2: \\n | \\n\\n 149 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n WHAT’S IN A MEGACITY? \\n\\n A Megacity is divided into districts, each of which focus on one or more central concepts: major Mythic influences and regional Sources; political key players such as corporations, crime syndicates, and government activities; subcultures that tap into fashion, nightlife, social activism, sporting, nihilism, or religion; natural or man-made disasters and the aftermath in the ruins; and so on. Some elements in your Megacity can cross over between Districts or affect the entire Megacity, such as a megacorp in control of entire swathes of the sprawl or a pandemic that knows no borders, but breaking the Megacity up into districts allows you to give attention to what is happening on the local level, which in turns makes your Megacity more interesting and Noisy, like a good cyberpunk Megacity. Each district also has its own story tag derived from its central concepts. This tag can be invoked by players and MC alike when in the district to emphasize its themes. To avoid overuse, district story tags should expire after a single use and be restored by the MC after each downtime period, although the MC may opt to allow more extensive use of the district tag based on her cinematic considerations. \\n FICTION,',\n",

       " 'PRE-MADE MEGACITIES': 'PRE-MADE MEGACITIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ISTANBUL \\n\\n Bridging Europe and Asia, the Megacity of Istanbul rep- resents the clashing mingling of culture particular to the Noise. Creed, religion, custom, and language act as battle- fields, upon which immigrants from countless countries fight for their rights to be heard. The complexities of this Megacity are rightfully called Byzantine, for the Mythos of that empire bends the city towards a chaotic kind of order. The Byzantine Mythos hides so seamlessly within the Noise that no one is yet aware of just how powerful it is; every- thing and everyone here is touched by its confusing effects. \\n ANATOLIAN SHORE \\n\\n Bureaucratic Dysfunction The Asian side of the Megacity has become a vast housing district, including sprawling shanty towns cobbled together along the hills above the Bosphorus. Here much of the industrial workforce comes home from menial jobs that often require many hours of commute time on the city’s hover railways and convoluted freeway systems. Due to the Byzantine Mythos’ subtle influence, all lives in the district are unnecessarily complex and bogged down by bureaucracy. \\n BURSA \\n\\n Corruptive Forces Once a major stop on the Silk Road, the city of Bursa has been absorbed by Istanbul from across the polluted Sea of Marmara. Perhaps inspired by its transportation focus, the area specializes in the manufacturing of vehicles, especially those that run on newer methods of propulsion, including experimental antigrav and Source-based. Several Mythoi connected to the Silk Road are active here, encouraging trade, innovation, and ruthless expansion. \\n BOSPHORUS \\n\\n Legendary Monsters The region of the city surrounding the Bosphorus Strait serves as a growing manufacturing and shipping center. The area is also home to a Conjuration of the Chimera, a many-headed fire-breathing monster that is known to kill important figures among the docker union as well as corrupt corp executives, although no-one knows how she chooses her targets. Monster hunters from far and wide seek out the beast, but none have managed to capture her. \\n FATIH \\n\\n Mythology in Action The former seat of power for both the Byzantine and Otto- man Empires of old is the traditional heart of the Megacity. Here on the historic peninsula the Hagia Sophia and other important centers of faith gather the power of the Mythoi in one place. Angels, demons, and their various minions walk the streets, emboldened by the legendary might of this place, echoing through the ages. An apocalyptic war is brewing here that will eventually endanger the entire world. \\n GOLDEN HORN \\n\\n Information Overload The financial district of the Megacity has expanded along the Golden Horn, the famed inlet of the Bosphorus. Here the Byzantine Mythos’s influence is felt as a chaotic pull towards cyberspace complexity. AI financial representatives meet on behalf of industrialists and corporate conglomerates, attempting to gain the upper hand by refining actionable data out of immense databases. Yet no answer is good enough, and overanalysis leads to countless gridlocks, which are often solved only through third party intervention (in the form of crews sent on jobs). The physical Golden Horn is mostly secured server farms; the real Golden Horn is fully in cyberspace, the bustle of activity producing a dull roar in the AR Nearspace of the district. \\n THE PRINCES’ ISLANDS \\n\\n Organized Crime This collection of islands in the Sea of Marmara has always been known as a refuge for dissidents and outcasts. In recent years, the place has become haven to criminals, hackers, and exiled oligarchs from around the globe. They have crafted not only a community that supports their anonymous existences here, but also a cyberspace Domain encrypted against all outside scrutiny. Here they hoard their ill-gotten wealth, hoping to one day spend it when the heat is off. This community is highly hostile to most outsiders, but tends to be willing to let mercs in, since they are a greatly needed resource. Many shady deals and illicit jobs are handed out from these tiny islands. \\n LONDON-MANCHESTER METROPLEX \\n\\n As the land of Great Britain consolidates into a single, island-wide metropolis, financial wizards tangle with hoo- ligan gangs enhanced with augs and sport drugs. From the factories of Manchester to the fog-shrouded castle-sky- scrapers of London, conflicts born of class, finances, and regional identity create an atmosphere of fracture and disillusionment with the mere concept of the nation-state. Scotland, defended by a strong government and intense cold, is safe from the encroachment of the Megacity – for now. To further complicate it all, the Mythoi of ancient Britain breathe new life into the establishment of the monarchy, while sparking a revival of chivalry and brigandry the likes of which the region has not seen in hundreds of years. \\n BIRMINGHAM \\n\\n Utter Lawlessness Known for its canals and being one of the first industrialized centers in the world, Birmingham has recently become overrun by punk gangs secretly funded by Brice Redcroft, a financial kingpin turned local MP, turned crime lord. Redcroft’s empire is growing unopposed and the street savvy fear he may soon spread his chaotic influence to the heart of London. \\n DIOCESE OF CANTERBURY \\n\\n Inspired Heroism The area of Kent, south-east of modern London, has been consolidated into a single theocracy run by a new splinter sect of the Church of England. Following a period of upheaval and schisms, Archbishop Sexton established order by way of a radicalized interpretation of the Divine Right of Kings, authorizing militias backed by international corporation support. The Archbishop radiates religious justice out from the Cathedral and Metropolitical Church at Canter- bury from which he rules. His most trusted followers bear crosses and other paraphernalia as Sources empowered with the Mythoi of medieval angels and even legendary crusaders – but thanks to this tyranny, heroic Mythoi are now swarming the district. \\n LEEDS \\n\\n Mythology in Action \\n\\n Series Setup \\n When the Metroplex began to sprawl together, like a cobweb across the island, Leeds fought back. The people of Leeds had already begun building green spaces, establishing a green belt of natural wildlife within its populous confines. Though climate disasters have threatened those spaces, the \\n | \\n\\n 151 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n reemergence of Druids with powers derived from Sources connected to nature and the ley lines of Britain have given the wild areas a chance to survive, and even flourish. Now the Druids work fiercely to protect the enclave they’ve established in Leeds from greedy corporate interests that would despoil those undeveloped plots and harvest the magical power inherent in the land. \\n CORE LONDON \\n\\n Automation Propagation The ancient heart of political and financial power in England has only grown more significant. Looming over the city is the Tower of London, a castle-like skyscraper that serves as the corporate headquarters for a powerful cabal of fi- nancial companies and decision makers. Few of the city’s denizens realize, however, that the majority of these pow- er-players have been replaced by android replicas created by a master roboticist named Alice, herself an android. A secret war is being waged behind the scenes, and no side has any interest in publicly admitting to be engaged in it. Political figures and multinational corps who would be at each other’s throat at any other time and place, find themselves allying against a common existential threat. \\n MANCHESTER-LIVERPOOL \\n\\n Industrial Pollution The industrial center of the Metroplex, Manchester-Liverpool is completely choked with pollution. Denizens must wear air filtration masks and goggles to navigate the city, though the wealthy get by with cybernetics to the same effect. Nearly everyone who still lives here is either too poor to move out or too stubborn to leave, but the filthy fog also covers the growing presence of immigrant Touched, people who are drawn to where no “right-minded fellow” will go, protected by various Sources. In recent decades, the sleepy collection of towns surround- ing Nottingham has been invaded by corporate interests seeking yet another region to turn into a capitalist heaven full of shops and factories. Surprisingly, it didn’t work: the corporate powers were overthrown by worker uprisings led by a group of outlaws. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these outlaws call themselves the Merry Men and they collect Sources con- nected to the Mythos of Robin Hood and other English folk heroes. The district is constantly in flux as corporate mercs, outlaw archers, and the remnants of local government butt heads, with no side having full control over what’s going on. \\n\\n | 3 // C R E A T E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n NOTTINGHAM \\n\\n People Pushed to the Edge \\n\\n 152 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n OXBRIDGE \\n\\n Cult Meddling The university district of the Metroplex is an amalgam of Oxford and Cambridge strewn between London and Birming- ham. Vast education centers house would-be technocrats and bureaucrats alike, ruled over by an academic elite who treat their students as serfs. A wide array of Mythoi active in this district stem from the libraries and museums that litter the campuses, filled with relics from across the world that serve as Sources. Secret societies abound as cults to dozens of forgotten gods congregate in the halls of edu- cation behind closed doors. \\n CARDIFF \\n\\n Legendary Monsters When the Mythoi began to reveal themselves to the world, Cardiff was among the first to notice because the city was torn apart by a giant from Welsh mythology. The great monster, Gogmagog, had a different name once but over many years it was corrupted and merged with that of the Biblical prophecy of the end times, inadvertently granting the giant incredible power but also driving him mad. A group of local heroes managed to lure the giant into the grounds of Cardiff Castle, where they defeated him and dissected his body into parts, to stop him from reforming. Instead of being taken to all corners of the earth as intended, however, all but one of his parts were acquired by power players in the Megacity, for research, military, and prophetic purposes. \\n NEW SAN FRANCISCO \\n\\n After the “big one” hit, the Bay Area was decimated, just as the scientists predicted. Like the 1906 earthquake before it, this more recent tectonic catastrophe served to wipe out much of the Megacity, which sprawls from the bay east to Sacramento and south into the California central valley. With the earthquake serving as a “reboot”, the city doubled down on its Silicon Valley associations. Now the downtown peninsula is claimed by the silicon megacorps while AI take over administration of the Central Valley. Yet their authority is questioned by a young programmer who claims to be the next iteration of the Kaknu, the heroic grandson of the trickster Coyote in Chocheño legends, an anthropomorphic peregrine falcon. \\n CENTRAL VALLEY \\n\\n Mythology in Action Sacramento and the other cities of the central valley have merged into a single strain of urban sprawl. Once one of the most important food producing regions of the United States, the area’s economy has collapsed in the wake of climate disaster and drought. Now the region serves as an inhabited string of stripmall towns with the one-time state capital as its jewel. Sacramento was leveled in the “big one” and in the aftermath the Mythos of the Wild West Gunslinger has taken over. The district became similar to a frontier town in the old west, in essence if not in aesthetics. Gunslingers hang around every corner, bounty hunting is rampant, and deputized citizens are the only law. \\n COASTAL SPRAWL \\n\\n Industrial Pollution As the manufacturing in Silicon Valley turned to cybernetics and robotics, the coast south of San Francisco was annexed by corporate overlords. Now what was once a collection of beautiful coastal towns have become an endless industrial zone, pumping toxins into the Pacific Ocean at what would be an alarming rate if anyone cared anymore. Criminal hackers have begun taking over a number of abandoned warehouses and industrial plants here, carving out a hard- ware utopia for themselves. \\n EAST BAY \\n\\n Virus Infections Oakland and its neighbors on the east side of the bay were hit particularly hard by the earthquake. Abandoned by the Silicon Valley corps that were supposed to provide cyber- security, cyberspace in the East Bay has become infected with every known computer virus imaginable. Some say such a vast outbreak is only possible through deliberate sabotage. Others say something from the Otherscape now dwells within the UC Berkeley Domains, spawning new viruses at an escalating pace as part of its own evolution. The end results in the physical world are the same: the streets have become slums, with barely any infrastructure available. With even Nearspace being incredibly hazardous, most residents have given up on any sort of cyberspace connection. The mountain is called Tuyshtak (“at the dawn of time”) by the Ohlone of the area, and their legends tell it was the source of all humans after a great flood covered everything but the mountain. The Mythos of Tuyshtak induces near constant flooding in the district and seems to be drawing other Mythoi of Northern California natives to it, making indigenous Sources fall into the hands of those who would drive the wealthy elite out of the district. \\n NORTH BAY \\n\\n Isolationist Enclave The owners of the wine country and wealthy estates of the North Bay saw the chaos of the earthquake as a sign of the times. Pooling their significant wealth, the elite of North Bay created a collection of closed enclaves known as End Points. Within these vault-like structures, the rich live in a bubble of paranoia and high tech gadgets. They employ mercenaries to patrol the vineyards they once tended, now overrun with climate refugees that have collected into nomadic vehicle clans. \\n SILICON PENINSULA \\n\\n Company Rule As the government of old San Francisco crumbled along- side City Hall itself, the corporations based out of Silicon Valley, now among the most powerful in the world, seized control over the Megacity. Taking over the entire Peninsula area, as well as what was once the Downtown area, these cybernetic and cyberspace companies now have their own world capital. The Megacity bends to their tech-focused will, turning every political action into an opportunity to expand their collective power over the people. Yet the corporations that run cyberspace are not perfect- ly aligned. They wage a shadow war against each other, invading each other’s cyber Domains and stealing trade secrets from one another. A few have gained access to powerful lightning and electricity Mythoi, which they use to fry each other’s hardware. It’s only a matter of time before the capital of cybernetics becomes an outright warzone. \\n MOUNT DIABLO \\n\\n Mythic Wilderness \\n\\n Series Setup \\n The district of Mount Diablo is the result of a corporate take- over of what was once the 20,000 acre Mount Diablo State Park, built as an exurban escape for the wealthy featuring the latest in holographic flora. However, the community has gained a terrible reputation due to malfunctions and hazards, created by the powerful Mythos of the mountain itself that seems to have been awakened by the construction. \\n | \\n\\n 153 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

The crew is represented by a crew theme, the shared resources and beliefs of the crew, as well as its weaknesses. It is built like all themes: three power tags, one weakness tag, and an Identity, Ritual, or Itch – a single statement or goal that en- capsulates the crew’s driving motivation or supernatural duty.',\n",

Order #218284 \\n For example, if a group playing a crew of tech mongers choos- es the Identity “Someone might as well scavenge what the corporations don’t want anymore”, all crew members should conform to this statement at least to some extent. If a team of ghost hunters feels compelled to fulfill the statement “We must put ghosts to rest peacefully if we can”, and chooses this need as their Ritual, it means everyone agrees that this supernatural demand is the most important thing, for now. Remember, the characters start the game already knowing each other and have worked with each other for a while, at least long enough to have a joint purpose. This is not to say all members completely agree on what drives the crew but simply that for the time being they agree to set aside any qualms they might have. During the game, the crew theme can mark Decay and be replaced just like any other theme (see The Crew Theme, page 75).',\n",

       " 'A NIGHT IN THE MEGACITY': 'A NIGHT IN THE MEGACITY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n As the end of the series setup draws near, you already have all the components of an exhilarating mythic-cyberpunk campaign: your series concept, crew theme, Megacity, and characters. \\n\\n In this final step, you wire everything together and do a test run to debug and tweak your series and to get an initial feel of the setting. You’ll now play through a handful of short and casual scenes where the purpose is not to advance the plot (although that might happen on its own) but to help flesh out the small details that are the connective tissue of the series. This will help the MC and the players learn a bit more about the player characters and their backstories, to connect with their motivations and their tags. You might even use this as an opportunity to revisit the basic rules and try out some quick outcome rolls (page 88). Don’t worry too much about running these scenes perfect- ly. This is not yet a game session depicting a dangerous merc job, it’s just a little vignette of your crew to establish the baseline of the player characters’ everyday life. It’s a dry run, designed so that everyone feels free to bump up against every misunderstanding and hash out small details. \\n STARTING OUT \\n\\n The MC starts by picking out a time, usually at night, and asking the table: WHERE ARE YOUR CHARACTERS RIGHT NOW, AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING ON THIS ORDINARY NIGHT? For example, MC Raycheal and players Matt, TJ, and Celine, have put together their Source-hunting crew, who are currently operating out of New San Francisco. \\n\\n Raycheal, the MC: It’s a typically rainy night in the seedy little-Vietnam neigh- borhood you all call home.

Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Where are you right now, and what are you doing? Let’s start with Matt. Matt (playing Malcolm, an augmented London- er hired gun): I’m thinking Malcolm is doing some arsenal maintenance in our tight com- munal area, with parts strewn everywhere on the dining bar, including parts of his body, his augs. He probably doesn’t even need to, he just loves polishing it and making sure it’s all oiled up. He spent the day doing odd jobs around the neighborhood just to make himself feel useful. His evening gun cleaning routine is mostly to relax, but also to stay ready for the next gig. He’s always looking forward to some action. MC: Makes sense. Okay, TJ, what’s going on in cyberspace at night? TJ (playing Rayth, a disembodied hacker): I don’t think Rayth sleeps, per se. He proba- bly needs a memory clean-up here and there, but he’s pretty much on all the time. He’s doing three things: he’s projecting a holo- gram of himself, a glitchy recording of his old body, playing cards on a chair next to Malcolm – that just helps him feel human; he’s watching the apartment’s Nearspace for any dangers to the crew; and he’s research- ing Artifacts of interest in the Tangle, trying to pick up a lead for a new job. MC: Celine, what about Amal? What was her day like and what’s she up to tonight? Celine (playing Amal, a werehyena witch): Amal is out partying hard, dancing in a jun- gle of glowing AR illusions in some seedy bar. She’s got a lot on her mind, what with the Gordian blackmailing her for her Esoter- ica, and she needs to blow off some serious steam. She returns to the apartment in the pre-dawn light, somewhat disheveled. You can tell she’s been running around as a hyena, getting into trouble. Maybe she grabs some comfort food from the fridge and disappears into her coffin bed. She’s quite the type. \\n ASKING QUESTIONS AND FLESHING OUT \\n\\n Keep fleshing out the scenes and note down new details that arise. Maybe one of the PCs has a conversation with another PC or with an NPC, visits a key location, or reveals a new aspect of the crew’s life. Whenever any of you wonder about a detail in the story, ask for it out loud. This is for everyone, not just the MC. Zoom in on what you find interesting, even if it’s someone else’s PC. Ask as many questions as you feel like. While this might be bad form during a regular game, since it’ll slow down the high-octane action, A Night in the Megacity is when you explore the basic setup of your campaign, so it’s the perfect time to get into the details and clarify anything that’s on your mind, such as: • A character’s appearance • A character’s lifestyle • A character’s daily routine • Where’s the character staying right now, and why • A character’s interface and dealings with the key fac- tions of your series, global or local • Trouble in a character’s life: factional, financial, emotional, etc. • How they manifest their Source powers • How they use their tech • Details about supporting NPCs, including loved ones and pets, contacts, or rivals • Major events in the character’s or crew’s history • The dynamics within the crew, and key locations import- ant to the crew When someone asks a question, suggest answers. This is a brainstorming session; let ideas fly around freely. Each player has the final say about their PC’s details and the MC has the final say about the setting, but it never hurts to spitball cool concepts. In addition, as the MC, take notes and say yes as much as possible. Take the player’s cues and integrate them into the setting. Nothing is set in stone and you can always alter details that don’t work later. Furthermore, not all details that seem interesting now will make it to the series. Track the open questions that seem most relevant to the jobs you want to run and the core concept of the campaign. Focus on what seems to motivate and draw the attention of the PCs and players and combine it with your own creative input. Continuing with Raycheal’s crew, here are some questions and answers that could come up during A Night In The Megacity: \\n\\n • Who is Malcolm doing odd jobs for? Maybe he has a friend in the neighborhood – who are they? A romantic interest perhaps? Or is there a local crime boss that Malcolm moon- lights for as a bodyguard? • Also, why is Rayth so wired (no pun intend- ed) about the local Nearspace? Has your crew been attacked before, between gigs? By whom? Or is there an ex-employer who still has it in for you because of something you stole? • How are the others reacting to Amal’s self-destructive streak? Maybe the comfort food she went for was Malcolm cooking her favorite Ethiopian dish. • Let’s talk about Amal’s partying hard and running around as a hyena. Do Source or mon- ster hunters in the district know about her? Is she developing an addiction? Was Gordian sending her creepy blackmail messages over the club’s AR and killing her buzz? What is the name of the club she frequents the most, and who does she know there? \\n WHAT TO AVOID \\n\\n Don’t tie up all the loose ends. Leave the most important questions open. What’s the deal with the new, strange CEO of the corp the crew works for? Why is there a perpetual shimmering cloud over the cargo drone docks? What hap- pened to your brother, who disappeared ten years ago? You’ll be exploring these questions during the game properly. Don’t escalate. Keep things cool, you’re exploring what the PCs consider ordinary life. If emotions or tension rise, bring them back down or resolve them “offscreen”, without playing a scene about it. If the subject matter is interesting, make a note about this for later, to explore it during the game. Don’t deep dive into the rules. Give everyone an opportunity to make a roll or two to get a handle on the basic rules, but avoid going any further. There’s probably no need to choose Effects or use a tracked outcome. \\n AT THE END OF THE NIGHT \\n\\n When everyone feels satisfied with the amount of detail you’ve gathered, you’re done. Consider making changes to your crew and character tags. You may have noticed some inconsistencies or better ways of wording them. Go over the tags and tweak them until they’re just right. Make sure everyone is aware of the changes, and that the MC approves. You are ready to start your series! \\n\\n Series Setup \\n • Rayth seems to have a need to feel human by enacting human activities, did I get that right? Does he often hang out with the other crew members as a hologram? Does he do it on his own? Has he ever inhabited an anthro drone to experience having a body again? Do the others know how he lost his body? \\n | \\n\\n 159 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284',\n",
       " 'CREATING THE MEGACITY MAP -  - FICTION, NOT PREDICTION': 'CREATING THE MEGACITY MAP\\n\\n\\nFICTION, NOT PREDICTION\\n\\n\\n START WITH AN EMPTY MAP \\n\\n First, take a map of your city. If you’re creating a new city from scratch, you can generate an artificial map using an online generator, or just pick any real world city map that interests you. If you’re working with a real world city, you can use a real map and adapt it to your needs – perhaps assuming today’s city has sprawled out dramatically, and/ or lost some of its territories to disasters, war, and Mythic forces. You could even start with a blank page and roughly jot down only the main geographical features of the region. \\n CARVE IT INTO DISTRICTS \\n\\n Second, circle the Megacity’s districts, aiming for about a dozen. In a made-up city, just circle the places that look like major urban areas. Real-world cities are already divided into districts, boroughs, prefectures, or the like, so you can pick the major ones. However, consider designing your own districts by merging neighboring areas or splitting up large ones. It’s your city now, and you should change it as you see fit to make it more futuristic, realistic, or easy to navigate while playing. You could do some research online to discover what’s interesting about each existing district, dividing the districts between your group, so each player can read about a different one and highlight its major aspects for the others. \\n NAME EACH DISTRICT, TENTATIVELY \\n\\n Third, give a name to each district. If you’re building your own city from scratch or greatly expanding an existing city, you’ll want to get creative. You might take names from the existing counties or other regional titles, from landmarks such as rivers and mountains, or from fictional people who might rise to importance in the future. Names could match the culture you think of as dominant in your city, but it’s always interesting to defy convention from time to time. \\n\\n In essence, the Megacity creation process aims to help you find interesting answers to the following questions. \\n ? \\n\\n How is your Megacity dystopian? Are people addicted to a common street drug, carefully watched by the government, or belong to corporations? Is life so dangerous that practically everyone has cybernetic replacement limbs? \\n ? \\n\\n How is your Megacity influenced by the Mythoi? Think about the culture and history of the place where your Megacity is set and extrapolate from there. Are there ancient legends, mythological epics, or shared modern narratives set there? How might those Mythic elements begin to infiltrate the Megacity? \\n ? \\n\\n Where and what are the Sources in the Megacity? Are there faerie circles or leyline crossings that serve as Thin Places? Do werewolves run around biting people, spreading their cursed power? Are museum pieces and hoarded relics secretly holding magic? \\n ? \\n\\n How has tech evolved in your Megacity and changed it? What cool technologies are popular? What radical inventions have changed which aspects of life, and how? How do people get around? What is considered everyday and what is cutting edge? \\n ? \\n\\n Specifically, what role does cyberspace play in people’s lives? Are the people of your Megacity addict- ed to virtual realities? Do they need to go there for work, staying home in a comatose state most of the day? \\n ? \\n\\n What terrible events have affected your Megacity? Computer viruses? Environmental catastrophes? Corporate warfare? \\n ? \\n\\n How is your Megacity laid out? You might use an existing city map and mark it up with districts. \\n\\n T h e M e g a c i t y G e n e r ato r \\n Don’t spend too much time on this, these district names are tentative and could be replaced once you populate them with historic developments. \\n THE',\n",

       " 'CREATING THE MEGACITY MAP': 'CREATING THE MEGACITY MAP\\n\\n\\nMAKES A DISTRICT? \\n\\n A district is a part of the Megacity that has its own character. It could be a center of corporate power, an automated industrial zone, a historical/ancient quarter, a suburb, a melting pot immigrant neighborhood, “[insert culture here] town”, a center of the Megacity’s most important commerce or industry, an academic or research center, a medical corridor, the famous enter- tainment district of theaters and casinos, or anything else. It’s possible for a type of district to appear twice or more, but to be a district, each should have its own personality. See the list of :Otherscape district tropes under Where To Go, page 41. \\n THE DISTRICT DIRECTORY \\n\\n Finally, list your districts in the District Directory table as shown here. To fit your districts into the table: \\n | \\n\\n 3 // C R E A T E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n • Merge two or three small, less populous, or less im- portant districts into one row • Allocate two rows for prominent districts. This table has 12 rows and uses d66 rolls: to choose an item on the table, you roll two six-sided dice or :Otherscape dice and treat one die as the tens digit and the other die as the ones digit, so that rolling 1 and 3 gives the result of 13. This will be used in the next stage of creating your Megacity. \\n\\n 162 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n You can also redistribute the numbers on the table to create a table with 9 or 18 rows, but note that the tens or the ones digits are always between 1 and 6. Here’s an example of a Districts Directory using the twelve boroughs of Berlin. \\n EXAMPLE: BERLIN DISTRICT DIRECTORY \\n\\n Zone Code District \\n\\n 11-13 Reinickendorf, Treptow-Köpenick, or Spandau (pick one) 14-16 Lichtenberg 21-23 Steglitz-Zehlendorf 24-26 Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf 31-33 Tempelhof-Schöneberg 34-36 Pankow 41-43 Pankow 44-46 Mitte 51-53 Mitte 54-56 Neukölln 61-63 Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg 64-66 Marzahn-Hellersdorf',\n",
       " 'DEVELOPING THE FUTURE HISTORY': 'DEVELOPING THE FUTURE HISTORY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n • The last die on the right indicates the specific Develop- ment. Compare it to the six specific developments listed under each Sub-Theme, numbered 1 through 6. Next, you will build up your Megacity with major events and decide how it evolved over time. How has its downtown area changed over the years? Which suburbs have become industrialized or depopulated? How have the Mythoi influ- enced the city? What major disasters have afflicted specific districts, shaping their futures? Continue to generate developments for your Megacity dis- tricts, interpreting each development as explained below, until your Megacity feels substantial enough to play in (usually around 12 rolls). Alternatively, you can go district by district and roll only five dice, dropping the Zone Code dice on the left. Each development is a historical event or gradual change that came over the district. It’s a moment in time, and whether it happened in the distant past or only recently, it has some importance on the present character of the district. For each development, note the Sub-Theme of the de- velopment as a story tag for the district (see What’s In A Megacity?, page 150). If you roll multiple times for the same district, choose whether to keep multiple district tags or keep only the most prominent one. \\n ROLLING FOR DEVELOPMENTS INTERPRETING THE RESULTS \\n\\n To generate each development, roll seven six-sided dice or :Otherscape dice and line them up like so: Developments can apply to the entire Megacity. The out- comes of these tables and subtables are intended to pertain to particular districts, but if you see a pattern emerging or really like an outcome, consider applying them to a larger swath of the Megacity if it makes sense. The emergence of assassination as commonplace in one district could spread to the heart of the metropolis and make the entire Megacity prone to such killings, for example. If it works, run with it; the randomization is meant to help your imagination, not restrict it. Starting from left to right and using the District Directory and the generator tables below, you can interpret each roll into a development seed, as follows: • The Zone Code dice indicate the district of the Megacity in which the development occurred: the left die shows the tens digit and the right die shows the ones digit, so rolling 1 and 3 stands for Zone Code 13. • The Thematic Code dice indicate the thematic pillar to which the development belongs in the same way: the left die shows the tens digit and the right die shows the ones digit. Compare the resulting number to the Thematic Pillar table. You can read more about each pillar on page 165. • The next two dice indicate the Sub-Theme of the de- velopment in the same way. Compare the resulting number to the specific table for the pillar indicated by the Thematic Code. [ THEMATIC CODE ] [ SUB THEME ] DEVELOPMENT \\n\\n T h e M e g a c i t y G e n e r ato r \\n [ ZONE CODE ] Place multiple developments on a timeline. When a sin- gle district gets more than one development, think of the first one rolled as occurring earlier, with the next event in the chain compounding with the first outcome over time, and so on. In this way you can explore how each district is changed by the ravages of time. \\n | \\n\\n 163 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Apply the ripple effect. Some outcomes sound temporary, but they might leave echoes for many years. Be sure to think about how they impact the history of the location, particularly when another development takes place in that same district (or another one nearby). This is especially true if the district in question is the downtown center of your city. \\n | \\n\\n 3 // C R E A T E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Ask yourself how it affected the locals. In order to keep your Megacity plausible and believable, remind yourself throughout the process that this isn’t just a place of ter- rors, supernatural and superscientific. Your Megacity is a place where countless lives are lived and ultimately end, often unceremoniously. Think about how people’s lives would have been shaped, pulled in divergent directions or pushed further and further towards a dystopian existence. \\n\\n 164 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

What used to be called the mainstream has fragmented into a million different subcultures and social silos, each with their own circles, hangouts, interests, and agendas. On top of the existing fashion cliques, tech clubs, religious groups, street gangs, and fringe punk movements, the Megacity is now gaining a new slew of subcultures based on Sources and the return of the Mythoi.

These are likely to come from the histor- ical cultures of the people who reside in the area, or from the region your Megacity is set within, but the melting pot nature of a Megacity means that nearly any pantheon could become relevant almost anywhere.

Some districts have their own cyberspace networks, separated from the rest of the net by firewalls and tight security, such as corporate data fortresses or private regional Domains. The Nearspace and its AR overlays are unique to a district, while local viruses, data weather, and online crime can impact those who live in the real world counterparts of affected cyberspace sectors. Domains, while commonly referred to as being on the ‘cloud’, are actually stored on server farms, and while these can be multiple sites anywhere in the world, the more sensitive or valuable the data, the more likely it is its owners would want to keep it in a physically secure location. When you roll a development of this category, choose whether it applies to cyberspace in a specific Megacity district, to cyberspace in the entire Megacity, or even to a global cyberspace event or trend. Perhaps the develop- ment points to a problem or invention that started in this district or gained popularity here, even if it is ubiquitous across the net.

The cult believes that Artemis, who is sometimes depicted as a mother bear, is Berlin’s secret patron (as evidenced by the Berlin flag featuring a bear emblem). The cult has taken over the Tiergarten park, living outdoors and hunting people in the streets around for their cybernetic implants, which the cult sells on the black market. \\n 46-13-23-4 Mitte Cities in Ruins Backfired Tech \\n\\n An autonomous drone army is loose in the streets, pro- grammed to exterminate criminals, having been created by the government to root out the Cult of Artemis. Having little success in culling the cultists, the drones have become a constant presence in the borough, enforcing every law and rule with deadly force. \\n 16-55-33-2 Lichtenberg Tech Noir Blackmail, Betrayal, & Bribery \\n\\n Based in Lichtenberg, the Abnoba Corporation keeps scrutiny at bay by having dirt on everyone. From corps to politicians, Abno- ba’s skilled spies and analysts use their background in industrial espionage to hold power over everyone in the Megacity. The corp rarely engages in commerce anymore, focusing all of its attention on becoming a bank of dirty secrets. \\n 64-65-26-1 Marzahn-Hellersdorf Transhumanism Bodies Modified \\n\\n A series of accidents a few years ago involved cyber-enhanced teenagers attempting to race U-Bahn magnetic trains. As a response, the borough installed various cushioning technologies such as magnetic dampers along roadways and jogging paths, and issued a requirement in new construction to feature smart “soft” concrete. The borough quickly became an attraction for those with ultramodded bodies, who use their superhuman strength and speed to casually run and leap through the streets. \\n 43-32-25-2 Pankow Mythology Weaponized Mythology in Action \\n\\n A portal to a hellish realm has emerged as a Thin Place within Schönhausen Palace in Pankow. The Baroque palace that was once associated with the East German elite played host to numerous Esoterica cults over the years. The most recent cult finally cast one too many spells within the palace, unleashing a Mythos of Hell closely resembling the Lutheran concept of eternal damnation – a place one may never escape. \\n 34-43-41-6 Pankow Sprawling Cyberspace Viral Cyber-attacks \\n\\n A powerful AI is running unleashed on the borough, continuously uploading the secrets of Pankow’s locals into cyberspace. Some in the Berlin underworld believe the AI is a demon, escaped from the hellish portal in Schönhausen Palace; meanwhile, a common online meme claims that the airing of secrets is the next evolutionary step for society, freeing the people from shame and secrecy. \\n 23-34-51-5 Steglitz-Zehlendorf Mythology Weapon- ized Magical Crimes \\n\\n Source-powered petty crime has become rampant, making everyday life much harder in this borough. Steglitz-Zehlendorf is the place to go to find weak, simple Sources, with a thriving black market that caters to small gangs and locals. Only the poor and the criminals live here – and outsiders who look out of place are not welcome. \\n 63-23-34-4 Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg Mythology Weaponized Corruptive Forces \\n\\n The violent AR game Blut got hacked by a foreign power, turning the already violent players of the game into a mind-controlled army. When not continuing their deadly games against each other, members of the two teams (east and west) sometimes lose a few hours of the day when they are “hired out” by the hidden masters as mercenary fighters within Berlin. \\n\\n T h e M e g a c i t y G e n e r ato r \\n 52-32-61-1 Mitte Mythology Weaponized Inspired Heroism \\n\\n In the oppressed Mitte borough, a hero rises to defend the people from the zealous drones who patrol there. This street hero embraces the handle Schinderhannes, after the famous German rogue. Schinderhannes uses some unknown Mythic method to destroy the overpowered government bots, leaving the scene and the drones’ valuable parts – which are then gathered by a small group of hackers who might or might not be affiliated with her. \\n 63-16-45-4 Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg Gangs, Cults, & Countercultures Fashion is Identity \\n\\n A bizarre new AR game “Blut” has the locals killing each other for points. Despite the death toll, its community is consumed by the promise to “fulfill any wish”, with some adopting its brutal ways as a lifestyle. The district, which spans the Spree river, is divided within the game into east and west teams who attempt to “tag” each other with smart bullets. The game’s popularity turned the double-deck Oberbaum Bridge to a constant warzone, with even Nearspace being tainted with Blut virtual warfare. \\n | \\n\\n 173 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n SELF THEME TYPES \\n\\n Self themes give you grounding in reality and tell the story of where you come from and what you want. They serve as the basis for your human self and what you care about. They also represent what you could lose should you pursue magic or technology at the expense of your personal life. The AFFILIATION theme type (page 196) represents your connection to other people, most often a group or culture, but also individuals. It could be a club, gang, cult, online social circle, or a loved one. It’s who you know, who has your back, with whom you can feel like you belong, and who you turn to for help. The ASSETS theme type (page 200) represents physical or digital resources at your disposal, such as a weapon, vehicle, safehouse, arsenal, or program library. These are signature items that you care about, and define how you see yourself and how you get things done. The COMPANION theme type (page 224) represents a magical creature or follower, who is capable of assisting you. Companions could be spirits, enchanted animals, myth- ological creatures, or magical constructs. They are often magical beings summoned by a Source, called Conjurations, with the exception of Familiars, who are their own Source. The ESOTERICA theme type (page 228) represents gaining powers through knowledge, a practice, or an art. It is likely tied to a human cultural practice, belief system, or magical system, usually with mythological roots. The EXPOSURE theme type (page 232) represents being imbued with powers by encountering something magical, traveling to a metaphysical realm, or becoming the target of a supernatural effect such as a curse or spell (also known as being Touched by a Source). \\n NOISE THEME TYPES \\n\\n The HORIZON theme type (page 208) represents your hopes, dreams, aspirations, and goals. It is a single driving force that keeps you on the right track (or the wrong one). It’s something you focus on and hope to live up to. The Noise is the way that technology and progress over- whelm us. Your Noise themes represent the ways that you’ve come to survive and even thrive in the face of a world in which change has become the only constant. The powers it grants involve mastery over technology, while at the same time represent virtual enslavement to it. The PERSONALITY theme type (page 212) represents how you behave. It could be your modus operandi on the job, your general demeanor, or your defining characteristic. It’s how you come off to others and also your mindset when dealing with problems. The AUGMENTATION theme type (page 236) represents cybernetic or biological enhancements installed into your body and mind, making you more than human. Many people have implants of some kind but yours are a step beyond, as befitting the type of jobs you take. The TROUBLED PAST theme type (page 216) represents a defining moment or overall background that has shaped you. It’s probably something bad (that’s the “troubled” part), but it comes with resolve and experience that you can use. The CUTTING EDGE theme type (page 240) represents a truly mind-blowing new technology you’ve somehow got your hands on. You might be its inventor, a test pilot, or a lucky thief who’s on the run from its creators. \\n MYTHOS THEME TYPES \\n\\n The CYBERSPACE theme type (page 244) represents a connection to virtual reality, online lifestyles, or other digital existence. You could be a hacker, a famous streamer, or someone who makes their living tracking online activities. Mythos theme types represent powers that come from Mythoi of the Otherscape. Each should be connected to a Source: a physical place, called a Thin Place; an object, called a Relic; an Esoteric practice; an animal, called a Familiar, or, rarely, another human being, an Avatar. The ARTIFACT theme type (page 220) represents an item which serves as a Source of power, usually a Relic, but other times a mundane item exposed to another Source. It could \\n\\n | 3 // C R E A T E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n The EXPERTISE theme type (page 204) represents training, professional development, and talent. This is what you’re good at, went to school for, or spent years practicing. It’s probably what you’re known for doing well. grant you supernatural abilities or have powers of its own. It may be an item straight out of mythology or legend, or a seemingly mundane one. \\n\\n 176 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n The DRONES theme type (page 248) represents control over one or more remote devices or robots. It represents not only the physical hardware, but also the skills to keep them maintained and coordinate their activities.',\n",
       " 'RAPID CHARACTER CREATION': 'RAPID CHARACTER CREATION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Rapid theme creation is recommended for players who are new to the game, those who just want to dive into the action, or those who are struggling to figure out what exactly they want to play. \\n\\n It involves picking options from a list rather than coming up with options from scratch. \\n AFFILIAT ION SE LF \\n\\n POWER TAGS \\n X \\n CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP \\n\\n EXPENSE ACCOUNT PR TRAINING MANAGING A TEAM COMPANY VEHICLE LEGAL PROTECTION \\n x \\n\\n HIGH SOCIAL STATUS \\n x \\n\\n WATER COOLER RUMORS MONITORED BY THE COMPANY \\n x \\n\\n CORPORATE LOGO TATTOO \\n Character tropes are pre-made sets of theme kits that describe a typical :Otherscape character. Each character trope lists three theme kits that are inherent to the trope, and three optional theme kits from which to pick your fourth and final one. The company is always right. Your fourth and final theme kit is up to you – this is your opportunity to customize your character trope and make it your own. Choose it from the three options listed in your character trope. Alternatively, you can pick any theme kit from any theme- book (starting on page 196), but make sure it doesn’t share a theme type with any of your first three theme kits. \\n STEP 3: CREATE THEMES FROM THEME KITS \\n\\n Each theme kit is a list of tags, representing a single concept that can work as a standalone theme. For example, the theme kit for a Trained Killer (page 207) lists power tags, weakness tags, and an Identity, all appropriate for an assassin. • Gain the first power tag in the theme kit (the title tag) • Choose two more power tags • Choose one weakness tag • Gain the Identity, Ritual, or Itch given in theme kit There, you made a theme! When you later upgrade your theme (Upgrades, page 133), if you choose to gain a new power or weakness tag, go back to the theme kit to pick one of the tags you didn’t pick before. \\n GET SOMETHING EXTRA \\n\\n At your option, in one of your four themes, you may choose an additional power tag. If you do, you must also choose an additional weakness tag in the same theme. \\n STEP 4: FLESH OUT YOUR CHARACTER \\n\\n Give your character a name, and flesh out some of the details in their themes, as well as those not covered by her themes, such as their personality, backstory, etc. Don’t put too much effort into this – more will come up during A Night In The Megacity (page 158), and even more will come up later during play. Find your character’s Essence (page 134) based on the balance between their Self, Mythos, and Noise themes, and write down their Essence Special on your character card. If you’re playing with a crew, list the names of the other crew members on your character card and pick a relationship tag to represent how your character feels about them, what they are to you, or what you are to them – after confirming with that character’s player: admiring, amused, angry, appreciative, bad blood, bossing them around, casual lover, communication failure, crushing, friendly, good vibes, hatred, have their back, in love, indebted, indifferent, jealous, leverage on them, look down on them, mentoring, mocking, need them for..., offended, painful to watch, party together, pining, protective, remind me of..., resentful, rival, soulmates, submissive, supportive, tandem, work well together. \\n\\n C h a r a c t e r C r e at i o n \\n Each theme kit lists ten power tags and four weakness tags for you to choose from. When you create a theme out of a theme kit, you: \\n\\n WORK RIVAL UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES \\n IDENTIT Y \\n STEP 2: CHOOSE YOUR FOURTH THEME KIT \\n\\n BRAND LOYALTY \\n WE AKNESS TAGS \\n STEP 1: PICK YOUR CHARACTER TROPE \\n\\n Go through the character tropes on page 178. Pick one to base your character on and note the three base theme kits that come with it. \\n\\n TIGHT-LIPPED \\n | \\n\\n 177 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield.

       " 'CUSTOM CHARACTER CREATION -  - WHAT MAKES A DISTRICT?': 'CUSTOM CHARACTER CREATION\\n\\n\\nWHAT MAKES A DISTRICT?\\n\\n\\n Custom theme creation is a more in- volved process in which you create your own themes, power tags, weakness tags, and motivations from scratch by answering questions. It allows you to fully customize your character. \\n\\n STEP 1: CHARACTER CONCEPT \\n\\n Every :Otherscape character is a survivor in a techno-mythic dystopia, anchored in their own identity but influenced by the temptations and opportunities presented by new tech- nologies and legendary magical forces. Finding a balance between these three elements is the struggle that every :Otherscape player character must continually face. Mythos themes draw your character back into human history and mythology, speaking to something primal inside and offering old, fundamental power. Noise themes promise new applications of science and technology, endless options to explore and ways to redefine what’s human. Between them is your mundane Self, connected to where you came from and where you might want to go. It is the truest part of you and losing touch with your Self is the surest way to becoming something inhuman. Mythos and Noise give you power, but the Self gives it meaning. To create a solid :Otherscape character concept, think up possible answers for the following questions: What do you do with your time? Do you have a profession, a job, a commitment, or a calling? What culture, modern tribe, social class, or community do you belong to? Or trying to be become a part of How do you use technology? Is it a part of your daily life? Are you an early adopter – by choice or not – of experimental or new tech? What inner or outside forces drive you to transform, adapt, or evolve? What activity, mindset, or person keeps you grounded or ‘yourself’? Where do you come from? Do you have a past you’d rather forget? Why do you still care about that? Who are you still connected to, despite everything? How do you help or interfere with each other’s lives? Use the answers as guidelines in the following steps. \\n | \\n\\n 3 // C R E A T E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Did you ever acquire a Source? How did it change you? What did you sacrifice for it? \\n\\n 190 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n STEP 2: CHOOSING THEMES \\n\\n Choose four themes for your character from the list of 14 theme types on page 175. You may use any combination. You can start by jotting down the four most dominant aspects of your character and then matching them with a theme type, or, alternatively, choose the theme types you want for your character and create or assign aspects of your character to fit those themes. It’s recommended not to have two themes of the same type, unless you have a really good reason to do so. You might want to have two Affiliations, for example, to force the character to choose between them. Find your character’s Essence, based on the balance be- tween their Self, Mythos, and Noise themes, and write down their Essence Special on your character card. See Essence, page 134. \\n STEP 3: ANSWER THEMEBOOK QUESTIONS \\n\\n Each themebook contains a questionnaire which helps you come up with your own tags and motivations for a certain theme type. The answers you give to the questions become your power tags, weakness tags, and motivations. \\n GET SOMETHING EXTRA \\n\\n At your option, in one of your four themes, you may choose an additional power tag question to answer. If you do, you must also choose an additional weakness tag question to answer in the same theme. As a result, you will have an additional power tag and an additional weakness tag on that theme. \\n POWER TAG QUESTIONS \\n\\n Each themebook includes ten power tag questions. You must answer the first question (in bold) and then choose two more questions to answer. The answers become power tags in the theme. For example, if you answer the power tag question “What surprising power can your Artifact unleash?” with “it creates a blast of powerful light”, then light blast becomes a power tag in that theme. A power tag must always describe something useful. It should not be used to describe anything neutral (like being blue in a series where being blue doesn’t matter) or anything that would hinder the character without also providing a clear benefit. To clarify or fine tune a power tag, ask: WHAT ACTIONS WOULD THIS POWER TAG BOOST? Answering this question helps define what exactly is helpful in a power tag and how the player is expecting to use it during the game (which should be clear to the MC as well, see Agreeing on Interpretations, page 192). Sometimes answering this question may also bring the player to rethink and rephrase their tag. Power tags can represent many things, for example: Allies and contacts: inquisitive boyfriend, underworld contacts, helpful fox spirits Augmentations: neural interface, wrist pistol, boosted nervous system Background and occupation: roboticist, supernatural investigator, hired gun Catchphrases or slogans: reach for greatness, unleash the beast, more human than human Gear, tech, or special items: smart pistol, scanning drone, old motorbike Hardware and software: harnessing console, military-grade virus, financial database \\n POWER TAG QUESTIONS \\n\\n A What is your Affiliation? B What’s the main perk that comes with it? C What useful skill have you learned from them? D What are they best known for? E What activities do you engage in for them or with them? F What gear, asset, or items did you get from them? G How do they protect you or vice versa? H What quality or status do you have that enabled this Affiliation? I How do you find escape from this Affiliation? J How has this Affiliation changed you the most? \\n WEAKNESS TAG QUESTIONS \\n\\n Knowledge: Megacity history, current events, cyberspace danger zones Natural abilities: alert, strong, intuitive navigator Privileges: corporate security clearance, cyber-celebrity, cult membership, full crypto wallet Skills: console modification, skyscraper climbing, VR gaming Sources: a magic ring of invisibility, deva summoning ritual, homunculus Source powers: blast of ice, invulnerability, speak with the dead Qualities of your Source powers: penetrates magical wards, spray fire, stronger at night Special maneuvers: jackhammer punch, jumping katana slice, subtle bribery Training: master swordsman, bomb defusing, car theft Useful personality traits: charming, indomitable, empathetic Useful qualities: street smarts, artificial beauty, covered in cybernetics \\n type:',\n",

       " 'CUSTOM CHARACTER CREATION': 'CUSTOM CHARACTER CREATION\\n\\n\\nON INTERPRETATION \\n\\n While the players are creating their characters, themes, and tags, the MC should ask interesting ques- tions and make suggestions to assist in their devel- opment. In addition, the MC should go over the tags, Rituals, Itches, and Identities created by the players and verify two things: first, that they follow the guide- lines in this section; and second, that she understands the player’s interpretation of these elements. Different people have different ways of expressing ideas, so players will describe their character’s tags, Identities, Rituals, and Itches in a variety of ways. The MC should encourage this and avoid limiting the players’ creativity. Within reason, the MC should put less emphasis on literal wording and instead try to understand what a player is trying to express. Use the questions in this section to help the player fine-tune these descriptors. Once the player and the MC agree on the interpretation of a theme component, this interpretation cannot be changed unless both the MC and the player agree to it, so that the game can run smoothly. This does not mean tags and other descriptors can’t be used creatively, just make sure there’s a clear and mutual understanding of what they mean, to maintain a good baseline. \\n Broad tags, on the other hand, are useful in a wide spectrum of situations – that is, a wide variety of different scene types and actions. For example, the tag cunning can be interpreted as being useful when getting a contact to talk, when deceiving a corporate official, when setting a trap, and when feigning a blow in a fight. While broad tags are very useful for the character, they tend to be less colorful and inspire less creative solutions. They can also poten- tially give the character an unfair advantage. Therefore, your character can have only one broad tag, across all of her themes. Tags that are useful in all or most situations, or tags that are useful in any type of scene, are too broad. For example, the tags lucky or cast magic spells can be used in almost any situation. Players cannot choose tags that are too broad; they must downgrade the tag as shown below. As an ex- ception, the MC may approve a too broad tag and consider it as broad, if the tag encourages interesting descriptions. For example, an MC may feel that while mysterious reality bending can be used in almost any situation, the player’s descriptions when using this tag will contribute to the story. \\n DOWNGRADING A TAG \\n\\n There are two methods to downgrade a too broad tag to a broad tag, or a broad tag to a specific tag. The first and simpler way is to add words to the tag to make it more specific, e.g., cunning → cunning negotiator. Consider the types of scenes your character can take part in: computer hacking, socializing with gangs, vehicle chase, fist fight, etc. Most specific tags are useful only in specific circumstances, like being familiar with nightlife culture at a busy night club or being tough as nails when taking a physical hit. Or, they are useful in a limited set of circumstances that are closely tied together. For example, being a bounty hunter can help with skip tracing, chasing down a target, or sensing when someone is about to flee, but all of these are very specific actions that are tightly related, making this tag still specific. The examples in the list above are of specific tags. \\n | \\n\\n 3 // C R E A T E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n SPECIFIC, BROAD, & TOO BROAD TAGS \\n\\n Almost all power tags are specific: they represent a pos- itive or useful element that can help your character in a limited field, a well-defined situation, or a unique manner. Specific tags give your character color and inspire you to use them creatively. \\n\\n 192 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n The other way is to agree in advance that a tag can only ever be indirectly relevant to an action (see Counting Power, page 87). An indirectly relevant tag always requires an additional preparatory action to use: the player can only use this tag in an action that creates other, specific tags that can then be directly relevant to the action they want to perform (using the Effects Create, Bestow, or Loadout, which means this can never be a quick outcome). This way, a too broad tag must always be adapted to different situ- ations in a way that receives its own spotlight, holds the risk of failure, and takes time and effort on the character’s part (just how much is up to the MC). Examples of too broad tags that can be downgraded this way include strategic mastermind (which can generate tags like battleground superiority or one step ahead of you), hermetic magician (which can generate various spell tags) or nanite omnitool (which can generate different types of gear and device tags). \\n WEAKNESS TAG QUESTIONS \\n\\n Each themebook includes four weakness tag questions. You must choose one question to answer. The answer becomes a weakness tag in the theme. Source power limitations: weaker in the dark, requires magical components, physically draining Source power side effects: callous mindset, horrific transformation, eyes like glowing embers Weakness tags must always be something that gets in the way of your character’s actions. Possessing (and controlling) the strength of ten men is often useful, so this would not be an appropriate weakness tag. If your character is compelled to help others, it may get her in trouble but it does not impede her actions – it spurs her into action. Therefore, this would not be a good description to use as a weakness tag (but it might be a good Identity). While your weaknesses often get in your way, they also help you grow (see Upgrades, page 133). To achieve a good balance between short-term success and long-term character growth, make sure you choose weakness tags that are not too specific or too broad, such as those in the examples above. To clarify or fine tune a weakness tag, ask: Each themebook contains pointers on how to create a motivation that fits it as well as some examples of mo- tivations. Read these to help you phrase the motivation for the theme. WHAT ACTIONS WOULD THIS WEAKNESS TAG IMPEDE? Answering this question helps define what exactly is limit- ing in a weakness tag and how the player expects to use it during the game (which should be clear to the MC as well, see Agreeing on Interpretation, page 192). As with power tags, answering this question may also bring the player to rethink and rephrase their tag. Weakness tags can represent many things, for example: Apt catchphrases: just a cog in the machine, don’t blow a fuse, takes two to tango Background: sheltered upbringing, from outside the Megacity, awkward nerd Denied privileges: lost citizenship, targeted by the police, damaged street cred Flaws in methods: exposed after mean right hook, sloppy technique, can be traced Gear or tech weaknesses: choppy reception, fuel guzzler, limited range Impeding personality traits: nervous, suspicious-looking, wallflower, overly regimented Impeding qualities: lazy bastard, highly visible, annoying smirk Lack of knowledge: not streetwise, outdated intel, poor manners Obsessions and compulsions: street drug addiction, freezes under stress, clean kills only Rivals and dependents: rival street gang, corporate nemesis, family obligations \\n CHOOSING IDENTITIES \\n\\n An Identity is a statement that your character strongly believes in and that drives them to take action. Identities represent your character’s ordinary persona: who she thinks she is, what she knows about herself, and the values she believes in. Only Self themes have an Identity. Your character’s Identities are her center of gravity. They represent her deepest beliefs or most dominant convictions, those around which everything else revolves and before which all other aspects of life bow. An Identity could be: • A conviction about yourself or your life, such as “I don’t need anyone else!” • A promise, oath, or commitment, such as “I will find the cure, whatever the cost.” • A preconception or prejudice, such as “Rich people can’t be trusted.” • A restriction, limitation, or red line, such as “If you don’t have the money, I can’t help you out.” • A greater wish, hope, or dream, such as “The new com- munity center will bring light to the slums.” • A strong feeling or emotional baggage, such as “I can never love again.” • A belief about the world in general, such as “Every- thing is better when you put on a smile.” An Identity is always an earnest and sincere statement that the character takes seriously (even if the players and MC are entertained by it). Your character does not have to be vehement about what she believes, only that internally, in her head, this statement is very strong. \\n\\n C h a r a c t e r C r e at i o n \\n Limitations: overworked joints, damaged hearing, slow on the uptake \\n MOTIVATIONS \\n\\n | \\n\\n 193 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n An Identity should always be directly or indirectly about the character and how she believes she must act or not act, in a manner that is relevant to its theme. It is never an unrelated sentence such as “The grass is green,” unless that has a specific meaning for the character which the player can explain. Identities do not necessarily have to revolve around mun- dane things; your character can have an Identity about obtaining Sources or fighting monsters. However, such an Identity should be associated with a Self theme that rep- resents this activity, for example Monster Hunter (Expertise). To come up with an interesting Identity, ask: WHAT DOES YOUR CHARACTER THINK OR FEEL ABOUT THIS ASPECT OF HER LIFE, OR BECAUSE OF IT? Each Self theme has its own Identity, separate from others, because each aspect of the character’s Self establishes a different part of her humanity. Acting in contradiction to an Identity too many times will make its theme decay and force your character to replace it. Everything described in that theme will then become lost, unavailable, or less important; it will receive little to no airtime from now on. Each Identity should therefore be directly or indirectly related to what is described in the theme so that breaking this Identity by acting against it can somehow be tied to losing or abandoning the abilities, qualities, knowledge, relationships, or possessions asso- ciated with the theme. A Ritual comes from your Mythos, but it’s tied to your personal connection to the Source, personalized to the character. It always begins with “I must”. A Ritual could be: • An actual occult ritual that must be regularly conducted, such as “I must make a sacrifice under the full moon.” • The need to acquire certain supernatural energies or oc- cult ingredients to recharge your powers, such as “I must harvest the fear of criminals to feed the spirit of Justice.” \\n | \\n\\n 3 // C R E A T E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n CHOOSING RITUALS \\n\\n A Ritual is a supernatural requirement that your character must fulfill. During the game, your character will be driven to keep this requirement fulfilled or risk losing access to the powers granted by her Sources. Only Mythos themes have Rituals; they represent your Mythos’ legendary demands of you, driving you to keep engaging in strange, often risky behavior to stay connected to the supernatural. \\n\\n 194 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n • A requirement to regularly behave in a manner consis- tent with the Source’s narrative, such as “I must follow the path of Prometheus and give technology to those without it.” • A legendary quest or destiny you must strive to fulfill, such as “I must seek the king of this land, destroy his kingdom, and slay him.” • A role you must play in your relationship with the crea- ture or entity your Source provides, such as “I must train and feed this dragon.” Mythoi are not sapient, they are stories that want to be manifested through human life. Therefore, all Rituals represent a cosmic law that links the Mythos and your character: if you embody the Mythos’ and resonate with its story while in contact with its Source, you will gain its powers by association. A ritual is therefore always a real requirement, demand, or task that the Mythos wants the character to fulfill, never something trivial or theoretical. However, every Mythoi has its own narrative and style, and so Sources are known to demand things that may seem impossible, silly, or even cryptic. To come up with an interesting Ritual, you can ask: HOW DOES YOUR MYTHOS WANT YOU TO RETELL ITS STORY IN THE WORLD? For characters with more than one Mythos theme, Rituals can be tied to entirely different Sources, representing the divergent needs of the various powers, or they could represent different ties to a single Mythos and its growing demands. Forgoing the requirements of the Ritual for too long will make the Mythos fade away and force your character to replace the Mythos theme to which this Ritual belongs. The powers described in that theme then become lost, unavailable, or less important; they will receive little to no airtime from now on. Each Ritual should therefore be directly or indirectly related to the powers of the theme so that abandoning the Ritual conditions can somehow be tied to abandoning the associated powers. \\n CHOOSING ITCHES \\n\\n An Itch is a driving need your character develops due to having access to a specific futuristic technology. For some, it’s born from the realization that the device in their hands grants them so much power, it’ll be crazy not to use it, and they find themselves heading beyond what others would consider healthy limits. For others, it’s the fear of missing out, anxiety due to lack of progress, or general discon- nectedness the character experiences when not engaging with that tech, when not using it to its fullest. Only Noise themes have Itches; they represent the impact of future tech on the human’s psyche. An Itch describes an obsessive pattern of behavior (due to the tech pressing all of the brain’s dopamine buttons), or a hyper version of a basic human urge (due to the psyche’s inability to handle immense power). An Itch always begins with a verb, like a directive, and you could add “I feel a need to…” before it. It could be: • A habitual need to use the tech whenever possible, such as “Explore new VR worlds.” • A directive to accomplish a certain tech-related ambi- tion, such as “Mod myself into bionic godhood.” • A driving desire to achieve mastery with a given piece of technology, such as “Get there fastest, get there first.” • A dependency you’ve developed on the technology to serve as a comfortable crutch, such as “Drown out the pain by feeding all my senses with content.” • A desire to use a specific application of a piece of technology you possess, such as “Slay with this na- no-edged katana.” An Itch should ideally feel like something you feel in the back of your head, an urge that needs to be satiated at some point sooner than later. It should not be a casual desire, but something that feels visceral: the need to do more, to experience more, to achieve the most. To come up with an interesting Itch, you can ask: WHAT DOES THIS TECHNOLOGY URGE ME TO DO? An Itch pushes you to be something more than human. These technologies are so advanced that the use of them will change you. It could mean thinking, existing, living, or dying in a way unlike any human has before. If you follow an Itch all the way, it would eventually lead you beyond the boundaries of what others consider normal, until you no longer recognize a need for companionship, sustenance, self-identity, or following social norms and morals. \\n CREW RELATIONSHIP SUGGESTIONS \\n\\n If you’re playing with a crew, you can have one relationship tag with each other crew member that describes how you feel about them, what they are to you, or what you are to them. Each themebook has suggestions on how to connect between the theme and one crew member, followed by a suggestion for a relationship tag. You can also create your own relationship tags based on your themes or completely unrelated to them. List the names of your crew members (excluding your own PC) on your Character Card and put the relationship tag you pick out for each one of them next to their name, after confirming with that character’s player that this re- lationship status works for them. \\n STEP 4: CHOOSE LOADOUT \\n\\n Your loadout theme (see Loadout, page 114) starts out with three power tags and one weakness tag. Choose items from the Street Catalog (page 252) and record their tags on the loadout theme card. The power tags may represent three different items, one item with multiple features, or anything in between. One of the items must have a weakness tag. Choose items that will complement your abilities well and provide options that you would otherwise not have. A concealed gun can be useful for a combat-oriented PC heading into a formal event, while for a non-combatant PC it provides an option to protect themselves which they might not have had without the gun. Conversely, social tools like the right clothing for a certain milieu can boost a socialites impact or keep an awkward character relevant. \\n\\n C h a r a c t e r C r e at i o n \\n Each Itch reflects only its own Noise theme. A character who has several Noise themes therefore has several different Itches, which might push her in different directions, all of them leading her away from baseline human norms. You can do this amazing thing. So why shouldn’t you? Why not do it all the time? And even more, even better? Use the device. And this one also. See where it leads. Your life and mind will change, as you become something else, something more. Resisting an Itch for too long will make its Noise theme break and force your character to replace it. The capabilities described in that theme then become lost, unavailable, or less important; they will receive little to no airtime from now on. Unlike with Self and Mythos themes, each Itch is already directly related to the capabilities granted by its theme. Therefore, resisting the Itch conditions is the same as the character willingly abandoning the associated technology. \\n | \\n\\n 195 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield.

They are also the smaller spirits, lesser known sidekicks, fantastic beasts, and other companions – who are not any less legendary. \\n\\n These mentors, advisors, and battle-allies are creatures of myth who are drawn to those who embrace the central role of hero or antihero in this dystopian world. They often look like monsters or mythological creatures, though the Noise keeps everyday people from thinking much of their presence. Most assume that such companions are just robots, biotechnological experiments, or just AR avatars or ornately costumed pets. \\n WHAT',\n",

New :Otherscape sourcebooks, such as Tokyo:Otherscape, present their own local Street Catalogs. \\n GENERAL AND SPECIFIC ITEMS \\n\\n Each catalog section lists general items and specific items. General items are tags that describe the items typical to the category in broad strokes, with suggestions for features and flaws to mix and match as you see fit. As a reminder, every item (a single tag or a set of tags) can have one weakness tag, added by the MC or the player. Specific items are individual products or services, with a name and a description, a set of 3 to 4 loadout tags, and a loadout weakness tag. The first loadout tag is always the item’s name and is applicable whenever the item is useful; the second and third describe additional features or add-ons, that are relevant only in specific situations; and the fourth tag represents an entirely different aspect of the item or a quirk that it has such as an unusual way or approach of using the item, an emotion it evokes in its user or in others. A specific item might look like this: \\n\\n ITEM NAME DESCRIPTION FEATURE TAGS WEAKNESS Gorts & Jasper KS-125 “Kiss Kiss” High-Precision Rifle A long-range rifle known for its reliability and modular design. high precision rifle, long range, tele- scopic thermal sight, reliable hard to conceal \\n | \\n\\n 3 // C R E A T E - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Before your :Otherscape characters embark upon a dangerous job, it’s crucial to prepare specialized gear.

On the other hand, some groups would like to keep things looser; perks are an excellent way to use up wildcard loadout tags, when in the middle of a Domain break in you suddenly pull out the digital backdoor access you’ve “prepared beforehand”. Perk tags that are about access and availability are com- monly used in quick outcomes to get into places.

Ammo tags can be used to augment attack actions with weapons that use that ammo, or for rolls to reload (quick outcome) or mitigate Consequences of running out of ammo (such as burning tags or a running-out status). See “Supply Issues” under Common Tech & Gear Statuses, in the Action Database. Ammo can be treated as a consumable tag (Consumable Story Tags, page 113). When a consumable item is con- sumed entirely in an action, the player should burn its tag for Power to reflect the greater effect derived from its one-time use (Burning a Tag for Power, page 122). Consumable tags can also be used normally to provide 1 Power per tag, in which case it is assumed the PC is ra- tioning the use of this consumable item to gain multiple uses with smaller effect.

Sources can also grant the ability to mitigate a danger that the PC would otherwise be unable to. Some Sources, such as potions, can be treated as consum- able tags (Consumable Story Tags, page 113). When a consumable item is consumed entirely in an action, the player should burn its tag for Power, to reflect the greater effect derived from its one-time use (see Burning a Tag for Power, page 122). Consumable tags can also be used normally to provide 1 Power per tag, in which case it is assumed the PC is rationing the use of this consumable item to gain multiple uses with smaller effect. A common Consequence with Sources is to have them be- have in a manner fitting their Mythoi but against the PC’s wishes, such as by inflicting cursed or charmed. \\n GENERAL ITEMS \\n\\n Items: blessed water, flight-giving feather, ghost- appeasing chant, girdle of giant’s strength, good luck talisman, invisibility ring, ironskin salve, locator spell, lulling lyre, magebane dagger, monster-slaying ointment, silent-kill whetstone, spider-climbing charm, spirit-binding salt, suit of beguilement, wristband of flames, wyvern blood rejuvenating shot Features: discreet, long lasting, stronger [at time / in place / if condition], stronger against [being], stronger against mundane, stronger against tech Flaws: activated with blood, attracts [being], easy to dispel, needs recharging, noticeable, only works [at time / in place / if condition] \\n\\n DESCRIPTION FEATURE TAGS WEAKNESS \\n Aegis \\n\\n A replica of the shield carried by the gods of ancient Greece, protective against nearly any blow. magical shield, deflect attack, awful to behold, stand your ground cumbersome \\n Demonic pendant \\n\\n This necklace bears an evil sign, which connotes bad omens but also a dark and powerful force. demonic pendant, inflict bad luck, command malicious spirits weaker in daylight \\n Glass of True Vision \\n\\n Looking through this rounded shard of sea glass lets you see through illusion and the true form of shapeshifters. glass of true vision, see through illusions, penetrating stare takes a moment for the vision to clear \\n Healing potion \\n\\n A magical cure-all, an excellent but costly solution to open wounds and broken bones. healing potion, close wounds, mend bones cyberware \\n Leyline map \\n\\n An ancient map showing the convergence points of various mystical powers. leyline map, helpful navigation, tap earth energies outdated A tightly worded contract with a devil, a fae, or some spirit, to provide a service. otherworldly contract, summon helpful familiar, preternatural advice, careful articulation small print and loopholes \\n Prayer beads \\n\\n Commonly used to count the prayers you have made, this Source strand has been blessed or otherwise consecrated. prayer beads, protection from demons, blessed guidance sarcastic user \\n Prayer beads, explosive \\n\\n Demonic beads, full of negative energy, ready to be thrown.

You manage the conversation around the table by moving the spotlight between players and from the players to yourself. Only a player who has the spotlight can take actions and affect the scene. You are the narrator. You describe the scenes in your groups’ shared story and introduce challenges and complications that the player characters (PCs) have to overcome. You also portray the non-player characters (NPCs) present at those scenes, such as supporting cast, people on the street, victims, villains, and other parties of interest. You are the referee. Whenever there is a doubt regarding the rules, such as which outcome to use, which Effect matches the description or which tag is applicable, you make the final decision. To do all of the above, remind yourself to: • Respect the players, both as an audience and partici- pants. • Respect the rules of the game. • Respect the job, the details you’ve prepared before the game. • Improvise based on your imagination, and considering your cinematic considerations and common sense. • Do what is fair, especially regarding the distribution of spotlight between the players. The rhythm and rules of your role as the MC during play are described in Chapter 2: //PLAY. This chapter covers some of the considerations that will help you create a great :Otherscape series and the tools to create your own series, jobs, and Challenges. \\n NARRATING OTHERSCAPE \\n\\n The lowdown on narrating :Otherscape, focusing on your cinematic considerations, which determine how you use the rules in Chapter 2: //Play. This section hones in on what makes the :Otherscape experience unique, from giving life to its themes to the difficulties of meatspace and cyberspace interactions. \\n DESIGNING A SERIES \\n\\n A general overview of the two main ways to approach an :Otherscape series: as a disconnected sequence of jobs united by the PCs’ personal journey, or as a coherent cam- paign revolving around a single story. In both you’ll need Key Players, the series’ main antagonists. \\n HANDLING JOBS \\n\\n Intricate advice on constructing jobs of all kinds and what makes them interesting and distinct, whether you’re de- signing beforehand or need to come up with new ideas on the spot during play. \\n\\n | 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n CREATING CHALLENGES \\n\\n A step-by-step guide to building thrilling Challenges or customizing existing ones to better fit your crew. \\n\\n 274 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

This should be rare, used as a counterbalance if the game becomes too saturated with cynicism. Keep NPCs morally gray. Make the good guys slip up: get carried away, distracted, or succumb to their urges or de- sires. Make the bad guys relatable: compromised by a third party, in the wrong place at the wrong time, or desperate. While some characters can be clearly good or bad, most should be a complex mix of both. Keep things messy, with loose threads. Avoid letting the player characters figure out exactly what’s going on in any given scene. There are always more forces at work behind the scenes, hidden motivations, and connections yet to be revealed. The Megacity is complex and many different actors may be influencing events, both mundane and Mythic. \\n FOCUS ON THE PLAYERS \\n\\n Keep the PCs central to the story. Have your NPCs make the wrong choices or get to the wrong conclusions. Assume that if there’s no PC around, things will get worse because everyone else is too emotional, logical, drugged, fucked-up, or have a powerful motivation to do something awful. For things to go right, a PC needs to take action. Ask provoking questions. Ask the players about their char- acter’s feelings and dark past. Ask about the happenings in the scene, what catches the PC’s attention. Let them describe and add details, and then use their answers in play. Force the players to make hard choices. Offer the player two Consequences, both just as bad, such as choosing between letting the evil scientist upload her consciousness into cyberspace (Escalate the Situation) or heroically thrust their metal cyberarms into the power source to cut short the upload (get a status). Respect and question the tags. Every power (and weak- ness) tag describes something about the character that is important for the player. Respecting a tag means allowing the PC to succeed without even rolling; questioning means pushing against it to see what happens. Both approaches emphasize the dramatic importance of the tag.

There’s a lot of information on your side of the table, with much of the game involving you presenting this information to the players, gradually throughout the job. Some of this info doesn’t exist yet – you’ll come up with it during play – and some might be imagined up by the players. But it’s always you who has the final say on if something is “true” in the fiction, and when to reveal it as such. You should be thinking about information not only as a means of progressing the story, as PCs find out where to go next, but also as a way of telling the job’s backstory. Reveal who the main players are, and show some of their “wants” and “pushes” (see Vectors, page 290). Even if not right away, the PCs should be able to piece together what led to the current situation or uncover the villain’s evil plot, thereby making the story make sense and hold meaning. Clues revealing what might be waiting next, capabilities of Challenges, or motivations of the bad guys, can be par- ticularly useful as short-term rewards for successful rolls and even as a means of blunting the sting of failures. Each scene should reveal a little more about what’s going on in the world. Characters should always come away from scenes knowing where to go next, who to be angry at, or what’s at stake in the bigger picture. The emotional groundwork you’re presenting through revealed clues in the first few scenes is priceless – when the players finally discover who is behind the wolf-eared Source-wielder that destroyed their safehouse, the payoff will be awesome. But they have to be able to gather some clues on how to find this person, or at least, to know to expect they’ll show their face again. Err on the side of revealing too much, because you can always come up later with another secret behind the secret.',\n",
       " 'GRITTY VS. CINEMATIC NARRATION -  - LOADOUT THEME SPECIALS': 'GRITTY VS. CINEMATIC NARRATION\\n\\n\\nLOADOUT THEME SPECIALS\\n\\n\\n :Otherscape is a cinematic game, which means that scenes often feature fast paced action that flows like in a TV show or a movie, and game sessions should ideally not get bogged down in mundane detail. \\n\\n At the same time, it is also intended to be a gritty game, which means that it should be challenging, suspenseful, and sometimes bloody. These could be seen as competing ideals, but weaving the two together is certainly possible, even though it’s a skill that needs to be developed. \\n CINEMATIC EMPHASIS \\n\\n Whenever possible, jobs, scenes, and the overall storyline of your series should feel a bit over the top. The crew should go up against cool-looking villains with cool weapons and cyberware, fighting against cool backgrounds. While many cyberpunk protagonists are antiheroes, the PCs should nevertheless have heroic moments, battling for their survival and sometimes the future of the entire Megacity. Players of characters in a cinematic game need to be given a bit of leeway when it comes to their actions. If a player wants their PC to do something cool and movie-like, you should help them work out a tag combination that could execute it, even if the chances are slim; a hero should at least be able to try to jump off a bike while shooting with two SMGs. They might fail, but even on a miss, something cinematic happens – because you can inflict a Consequence. \\n GRITTY EMPHASIS \\n\\n In order to keep things cyberpunk and dystopian, a bit of gritty difficulty can help. That means not holding back on damage and complications, particularly those that reverse Another element of gritty storytelling is zooming in on human issues. Show the consequences of corporate greed, government dysfunction, street level problems, and the everyday struggle to find meaning in a world bombarded with meaningless Noise. Everything should be personal, which means most NPCs need names and drives, at times even complex motives and backstories. When a computer virus shuts down the cybernetic hearts of the elderly in the city, the PCs should ideally know someone impacted and want revenge. That wasn’t just some insidious hacker “prank” – that virus killed Old Mary, one of the only people over 60 the crew ever met. She gave them shelter when no one else did, because she dared to trust them. She used to get them to pick up her groceries from the corner store when she wasn’t feeling well. Now she’s dead and ideally the crew should care about that, giving them a motivation to act and an immersive sense of a palpable fictional world. \\n THE SEASONED EXPERT STANDARD \\n\\n One basic premise of job-based games is the seasoned ex- pert standard. This is a guideline which says that a character who is a professional should be treated as such. As MC you should therefore treat most PCs as capable of doing their part of a job (any highly synchronized operation) with skill. In general, they won’t make mistakes unless the situation is dramatic or dangerous. Even if a roll is invoked and the player gets a miss, the Consequences should arise out of the situation, not a humiliating failure on the PC’s part. A typical PC is assumed to know how to be a merc, but the player might not, particularly in a fictional setting such as this. This means the player should feel comfortable to ask the MC basic questions about how to best proceed and get straight answers, whether it’s a logistical topic or a clarifi- cation about a social situation. Their characters are used to the rough and tumble social structure of the street and should know when they’re about to make a boneheaded move. If a player describes what would be a faux pas in the fiction of the world, point it out so that they have a chance to reconsider. \\n\\n N a r r at i n g : Ot h e r s c a p e \\n Try to use movie logic whenever possible. In real life, the gas tanks on vehicles have been specially designed to keep from exploding, but movies tell us that a stray bullet, electrical bolt, or sudden impact could cause a ball of fiery explosion. If it suits the narrative and makes the scene awesome, you could let a PC (or Challenge) go ahead and blow up a vehicle by targeting the gas tank. You probably don’t want to let a player have his character just go around blowing up cars left and right outside of chase scenes and gunfights, but if the scene will be better for it, it should happen. fortunes, provide setbacks, or make the player say, “woah, shit just got real”. Try not to go overboard with this or your game may garner a depressing tone. Use the rules as written to make sure Challenges feel tough to beat yet not impossible. Keep the story full of potential enemies popping up unexpectedly to escalate things. But don’t throw a grenade into the room every time – you want to keep the players on their toes, not turn them paranoid. \\n | \\n\\n 277 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n A seasoned expert will not forget to bring basic tools or weapons, just because their player neglected to mention doing so. A PC should be allowed to try almost anything that makes sense for their character, even if they don’t have appropriate tags. For example, it’s safe to assume a cat burglar has some lockpicks, a gunslinger has some ammo, and a hacker has a few programs. Basic actions taken by a specialist in their field of expertise should be considered certain, which means they should only be rolled for if they’re also dramatic. If the locked door is leading someplace unimportant, the infiltrator should simply succeed when they’re picking the lock. Sometimes the MC would like to require a tag (For the MC: Adjudicating Player Actions Based on Tags, page 89) or a player would like to have the right tag, and that’s what wildcard loadout tags are for (Wildcard Loadout Tags, page 115). This allows characters to always have just the right tool at the right time, which makes them feel like capable professionals who packed what would inevitably be needed. \\n SOMETHING INEVITABLY GOES WRONG (AND THAT’S A GOOD THING) \\n\\n The degree to which you utilize Consequences to shake things up will have a big impact on the tension of the story. Consequences that arise from missed rolls are always fair play – the player invited them – but you should have a light touch on the trigger. Usually, Escalating the Situation or Presenting a New Challenge are better used after a critical moment, to add drama and stakes, rather than seemingly at random after some action failed. Having a security robot activate just as a PC is fleeing a security area is far more dramatic than just putting it behind the next door during the initial exploration. Timing is everything. See the Action Database for countless suggestions of Consequences that make sense in specific situations. \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Counterbalancing the seasoned expert standard is the principle of inevitable chaos. As ready as a PC might be, the world is simply too complex and something unexpected will happen – possibly a very dangerous something. Jobs need to have the occasional injection of chaotic downturns of fortune, otherwise they run so smoothly that no drama happens. Fortunately, you have Consequences, exactly for this reason. \\n\\n 278 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n THE',\n",
       " 'GRITTY VS. CINEMATIC NARRATION': 'GRITTY VS. CINEMATIC NARRATION\\n\\n\\nOVER-PREPARING PLAYER \\n\\n Some players tend to fully invest themselves in plan- ning and preparation scenes, trying to get every last bit of edge they can, to be as prepared as super-hu- manly possible. This can be time consuming and the other players are meanwhile left unengaged. There are three ways to mitigate this. Firstly, it can be useful to remind the players of the seasoned expert standard. It can be assumed that a group of profes- sionals will cover all the major issues that might crop up on the mission. The players don’t need to try and account for the normal problems typical of a job of this kind. It’s okay for the group to just move on to the action and let everyone assume that problems that crop up will only be those caused by Consequences, rather than player negligence. The second way to mitigate overplanning is forcing the story to move forward by use of a Consequence. This should only happen if the group is truly dawdling and ignoring the seasoned expert standard. If a group is taking its sweet time, you should present a Threat to show the timetable is not waiting for it, then follow with a Consequence if the Threat is ignored. Maybe the target changes their travel plans. Maybe the crew’s employer needs things to happen sooner. Maybe the PCs learn that if they don’t act soon, the target will have far more security to back them up, a common trope in merc sto- ries. Whatever the reason, the crew needs to take action or their window of opportunity is going to close. Finally, you can use the Flashback and Prep Sequence rules (page 125) to cut out long preparation before a job. Dive straight into the action and have the story flash back to the PCs past preparations whenever they come across an obstacle that they would have prepared for.',\n",
       " 'HACKERS, HARNESSING, & OPS SUPPORT': 'HACKERS, HARNESSING, & OPS SUPPORT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n A staple of cyberpunk and modern thrillers is the hacker who stays back at the headquarters or in the van, while the rest of the team actually goes on the mission. \\n\\n This is a necessity in a tech-heavy setting – someone needs to be in charge of dismantling digital threats, and there’s usually no reason for them to be in the field. A similar co- nundrum is presented if a player wants to have a character who stays behind as the “guy in the chair”, providing ops support such as intel, live surveillance, or leadership. :Otherscape easily supports this style of play, since none of the rules are inherently local. A player can take an action for something that happens elsewhere, by a secondary character, and a distant Challenge can inflict a status. It all depends on the tags you use, and no place is safe from Consequences. The question isn’t if it’s doable, it’s whether everyone is having fun in such a scenario and whether this makes sense for every scene. If the group needs to chat with a local gang to find out who they’re working for, they might all come out just for numbers. But when they need to pull the trigger on a break in, sending the heist experts and muscle out might make more sense, with support staying back in the van. There’s a balance here that each group will need to figure out for themselves, and which could change over time. The intelligence analyst might eventually want to go out into the field, maybe after replacing a theme. The hacker might want to take matters into their own hands and grab a gun, especially if an Identity or an Itch is on the line. \\n\\n N a r r at i n g : Ot h e r s c a p e \\n Occasionally the happenings in cyberspace are important enough to justify a lot of airtime, but that runs the risk of making the job all about the hacker, with the other crew members waiting “outside”. :Otherscape solves this with the existence of Harnessing technology. Effectively, all members of a crew are potential hackers, since if they Harness, they can use all their real-world abilities in VR. This means that brutes and brains alike can be quite capable in cyberspace jobs, albeit in different ways: The brute can hit as usual, while the brain can hack the environment itself. \\n | \\n\\n 279 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " 'GATHERING IDEAS': 'GATHERING IDEAS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n SERIES SETUP WITH YOUR PLAYERS \\n\\n When planning out your series during Series Setup (page 145), it’s important you listen to your players and pay attention to the kinds of characters they are creating. If someone comes up with an idea that seemingly doesn’t fit the crew concept you’ve all decided on, ask them to explain it or adjust the series concept accordingly, with everyone’s approval. The characters need to be the kind people who will do the kinds of jobs that fit your crew and series concept. Write down for yourself any “hook” that seems interesting and worthy of exploration. Consider the following questions: • Does anyone have a Ritual you’d especially like to see them defy, an Identity you’d like to see questioned, or an Itch you’d like to see them succumb to – or resist? Focus on one or two for each player. • Are there NPCs, loved ones, mentors, assistants, col- leagues, or others, who feature in a PC’s personal story that could easily be put in danger? • Is there an obvious narrative arc that one or more player characters seems primed to enact, like redemption, re- venge, or opening up? What kind of story would naturally lead to this kind of growth and change? ple from their own past. The crew might go on a few jobs for cash here and there, but the focus is on surviving the attention of a Key Player, getting revenge against them, or otherwise “beating” this foe. While this is happening or later on your own, you can start asking yourself questions that can help you develop an over- arching narrative for the entire series. Things will change, and frequently, so don’t try to build a coherent, single script. Instead, decide on several Key Players, the main organiza- tions that face off against, or sometimes join with, the crew. You can sit down with your players during Series Setup and decide on one of these two approaches together, or you could play it by ear and see where the narrative takes you. No job goes to plan and both the players and the dice will often surprise you. A dramatic twist in an early job could easily be the launching point for a series based around a Key Player who was ultimately behind the job, turning a Paycheck series into a Misfits one as everyone around the table comes to agree that this Key Player needs to be taken down. Consider the following questions: • What kind of villain or adversarial organization naturally goes up against this kind of crew? • Do any of the characters have enemies right off the bat? Could the enemies of different player characters work together against them, or become united by some other force? • Are any of the player characters currently on the run or being hunted by an organization? • Is the group totally mercenary or do they have a cause they care about? What organization is involved with that cause? \\n PAYCHECKS AND MISFITS \\n\\n There are many ways to play :Otherscape, but they can generally be mapped between the two following poles, each is a series structure focused on a different element of the game. While you can try to push toward one or the other, either could rise up naturally during play, depending on what you as a group come to decide is important and interesting – so be attentive and flexible. • Misfits Series. Also called “story-driven”, this game is defined by the misadventures of the crew as a group who faces off against constant and repeated opposition. It focuses on the intrinsically outcast or renegade nature of the characters and their relationship with authority, a corporation, or peo- \\n\\n Example: The Five Boroughs Crew takes a job escorting a critical cybernetic implant to a waiting corporate executive who supposed- ly needs the cybertech to live. They face off against the exec’s enemies, a group of street punks who claim that the corp has been hunting them in the streets for sport. The crew listens to their stories and becomes sympathetic, but in the end they deliver the device as planned. They watch the tech get installed and then see their employer perform a murder while testing the systems. They go home paid, but have a strong sensation that they were probably in the wrong. In a Paycheck approach, the players are not attached to the particular NPCs introduced in the job or their situation. The next job that the Five Boroughs Crew goes on could be entirely unrelated to this last one. Unattached doesn’t mean unaffected though, and one or more PCs might be changed by the experience, their choices leading to the De- cay of their themes or affect their overall character evolution. In a Misfits approach, the players perhaps really connected with the punks they en- countered, and they become allies with the gang and take on their former employer as a villain. You could flesh out this corporation as a Key Player and let the PC crew find evi- dence of even more misdeeds the company has committed. \\n\\n Designing a Series \\n • Paycheck Series. Also called “character-driven”, this game is defined by a series of jobs, often of escalating difficulty and importance, but the jobs don’t really mat- ter. The major narrative arcs we care about are personal for each PC, as each character is changed by the things they’ve seen and the deeds they’ve done. Certain jobs could stand out as dramatically relevant and perhaps custom suited to specific members of the crew, but the overall structure of the series is episodic, with each job a separate story. This approach allows the players to get the satisfaction and drama of having their characters react authentically to events happening in their lives. This can happen again later on: whenever a job stands out as important to the players, the characters and groups involved could become more central adversaries and allies going forward. \\n | \\n\\n 281 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n STORIES FROM THE MYTHOI \\n\\n The Mythoi can aid you in building narratives, because they are narrative in their very nature. Some are derived from epic stories of fantastic beings battling it out for the fate of humanity, while others are intimate tales that can inspire personal character arcs. If a player has picked a specific Mythos to draw her charac- ter’s power from, the legends of that Mythos are probably a great place to look for inspiration. Give that player the chance to have her PC’s action echo those of her Mythos. Set traps, build villains, and use narrative tropes that the Mythos is known for. On occasion, turn things around, just to drop in a surpris- ing twist. The magic of the Mythoi is something akin to technology in the eyes of the corps – a repeatable effect that can be reliably used, but also, forced into a shape that better suits one’s needs. While a Mythos has a story built into its very existence, that story will often be subverted, flipped, or even defied by those who wield it in the Megacity. A reimagined, surprising cyberpunk version of a known tale will often be more appealing to your players than an on-the-nose, been-done one. \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Expect the player to also choose a different course for their character, straying far from the “proper story”. The character is not a direct reflection of their Source, and indeed, they may be touched by any number of different Mythoi. This conflict between Mythoi and the character’s Self (and/or Noise) is the whole point of motivations, and exploring it during play shows who the character is becoming and what part of themselves they are willing to leave behind. \\n\\n 282 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " 'MAPPING OUT KEY PLAYERS': 'MAPPING OUT KEY PLAYERS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n WHAT ARE KEY PLAYERS? \\n\\n A Key Player is an organization or some other institution – government, grassroot, Source cult, anything – that is playing a key role in your series. Cyberpunk stories like to showcase gritty heroes up against a faceless bureaucracy, unfathomable extremist factions, or weird cults. But they also like friends becoming enemies, betrayal by allies, and awful truths hidden behind mundanity, so not every Key Player is necessarily pure evil right now – but they all have the potential to be adversaries in the series’ future. See the example core :Otherscape Key Players in Chapter 1: //Imagine, page 46. Though most Key Players likely have a leader at their center, it’s the unkillable idea of an institution that’s the real enemy. It can’t die, has no will of its own, and is too big to fight, and yet all of these corporations, governments, and unseen splinter groups are the ones who run the world. The situation is frus- trating and perhaps impossible to grapple with – that’s the struggle these post-modern antiheroes should face. \\n USING KEY PLAYERS IN YOUR SERIES \\n\\n Key Players supply useful fodder for stories and scenes, such as goons to fight, specific technologies and Mythoi they’re experimenting with, thwartable goals that are grounded in ideology or greed, villainous leaders that can evolve as the PCs do, and places of interest they’ve claimed as their own. Due to their organizational nature they have predictable themes and patterns, and even though they will occasionally have a surprise in store, the players can come to know the Key Player and be able to predict at least some of their moves and capabilities, which is a comforting thought. This doesn’t mean Key Players must remain static. The data harvesting cybertech firm could learn the secrets of Esoteric magic and become a company of rogue sorcer- ers, only to later get bought out by a rival and turn into a subsidiary of a much bigger threat. You can use such institutional transformations to serve as pivot points for the series plot, allowing the crew to explore all new kinds of adventures as their enemies change. This could also become a means of bridging one story arc and the next, as even when one villain is killed, another can rise up and transform the seemingly defeated Key Player organization. It can be useful to center your series on the exploits of the various Key Players of your Megacity, whether those from Chapter 1: //Imagine or ones you create yourself. When you plan ahead, you can anchor an overarching plot into the nefarious deeds of a megacorp overtaken by a Mythos it has exploited. When you need to come up with a reason for an event, it could be the result of a battle between two rival Key Players. It’s best to have a handful of different Key Players, with a variety of methods, capabilities and goals, so you always have options when you want to connect an established event or an intended event to the rest of the happenings in the series. \\n TWIST \\n\\n Once you’ve got your basic concept, think about the twist, and keep in mind that there can be more than one. \\n DESIGNING A KEY PLAYER \\n\\n Your twists should also include Mythos elements. Most Key Players are going to be dabbling in Sources of Mythos powers in order to get a leg up on their adversaries. Has one or more Mythoi run amuck in the institution? This is where doing a little real world research might help, mythologies are full of unusual ideas. Is there a story from legend that would be interesting to retell in a cyberpunk world? Building up an entire organization can seem a little daunt- ing at first, but bear in mind that you only need the basics for starters – and if the organization isn’t cutting it, you can always change it or replace it with an even bigger Key Player, who has been pulling the strings the entire time. \\n CORE FEATURES \\n\\n Finally, jot down some ideas for the core features of the Key Player: key characters, resources, an agenda, and motifs. • Key characters are named NPCs who have a role to play in the organization, an interesting Source or piece of tech, and their own plots and schemes in which the crew can get entangled in. • Resources cover the main types of obstacles and Challenges the crew could encounter when facing this organization, its iconic capabilities, including soldiers, Sources, gear, and so on. \\n\\n Designing a Series \\n BASE CONCEPT \\n\\n Begin with a central concept for a group active in the Meg- acity or the world at large. You can base it on the needs of your series – for example, if your crew concept calls for one – or take inspiration from somewhere and just come up with something that piques your interest. Is it a gang, a cult, or a corporation? Maybe something seemingly innocent, like a charitable trust, museum, or relief organization. It could center on a single individual, like a politician, CEO, or religious leader, or it could be a sprawling hierarchy with different departments working at odds or ignorant of one another. What a futuristic version of your central concept might look like? What’s a cyberpunk cult all about? Is it entirely online? Do they fetishize a certain kind of cybernetic implant? Do they eschew cyberware? What are their beliefs? \\n | \\n\\n 283 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n • Agenda is the overarching story explanation, the main nar- rative impetus behind the appearances of this Key Player in a scene: What they’re trying to achieve, and how. • Motifs are symbols, colors, words, or stylistic elements that define the look and feel of everything this Key Player is doing. For example, a motif of beehives and honey. \\n EXAMPLE KEY PLAYER: CRYOCHARM \\n\\n Example: The MC has decided, based on the crew’s initial concepts, that a sprawling cor- poration involved in high tech cryonics could be a fun adversarial Key Player, tied to a wintery Mythos (Base Concept). She decides it should be led by a CEO she names Skye Carlin (Key Character) who will be one of those high- ly public industry leaders we all have to hear about on social media. She’ll also secretly be the Avatar of the Cailleach (Twist), an Irish/ Scottish legendary witch, strongly tied to the season of winter. Avatars are rare in :Other- scape, but rare things still happen. She decides that the series will be struc- tured around the CryoCharm corporation’s various schemes, the first of which will be their involvement in manipulating the weath- er in the Megacity by creating a great vortex out in the bay. The PC crew will be hired to go out on a boat and investigate mysterious nautical disappearances by a company that has lost a few ships recently. This will lead to evidence of CryoCharm involvement as well as clues as to the Mythos involved – the winter witch Cailleach. From there they draw the ire of CryoCharm, so follow up missions likely involve an attack by conjured winter wolves and fanatical ecoterrorists who work for the corp in secret (more resources). \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n As a technology, cryonics has all kinds of futuristic applications such as carbon cap- ture or cryogenic stasis for medical pur- poses or space travel, and it could involve fast-freezing tech that might be a fun weapon in the hands of the corporation’s security forces (some Resources and Motif). The witch- es of Scotland seem to have prophetic powers, such as with the Wayward Sisters featured in Shakespeare’s Macbeth. The MC decides to com- bine all of this in the legend of this corpo- ration that she’s calling CryoCharm. This Key Player will claim to be doing good, working to stop an impending climate catastrophe, but in truth they’ll be working to take advantage of the fallout from a calamity that Skye has foreseen using her witch powers (Agenda). 284 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " 'HANDLING JOBS': 'HANDLING JOBS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Player characters in :Otherscape come together as crews to do jobs. Jobs are the basic building blocks of your series, as they give the group an objective to work towards with the lure of pay, new interesting gear, and a growing reputation on the street. \\n\\n Even if the concept of the crew does not revolve around taking on missions from an employer or other sponsor (such as Wanted, page 149), the basic idea of a job is a useful framework for building scenarios in :Otherscape. \\n STREET MORALITY, JUSTIFIABLE MOTIVES \\n\\n Before you start designing a job, we should talk about what makes a “job” different from an “adventure”. A job is not simply a reskin of a fantasy adventure, with more chrome and less elves. A job should address some of the goals and themes of your crew members as well as the main themes of your series. Ethics and motives often converge during jobs, where characters are confronted with difficult choices. Do they take the easy path that also risks innocent bystanders? Do they act against an Identity, when an Itch demands their attention? Do they set dangerous prisoners free, just to create a distraction? Is revenge against a corporation worth the personal costs? The answers to these questions aren’t clear cut, which makes them interesting. Some crews, such as those of Elite Specialists, may have become so cynical they’ve given up on doing the right thing. And yet, even such hard boiled veterans of this dismal future can still be moved by dilemmas involving the precious few friends and loved ones they still have. Look at their themes to see what they care about. Even as ethical dilemmas form an important part of each :Otherscape story, be sure to keep in mind the morality of the street. Being hard means showing little compassion and surviving despite hardships. This is the world these player characters were raised in and they’ll often take the less empathetic route to success on the job, at least at first. This is an area for growth that could easily change as each character changes themes and transforms (Character Evolution, page 140 ).',\n",
       " 'TYPES OF JOBS': 'TYPES OF JOBS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Here are the few job types mentioned in Chapter 1: // Imagine, with their basic structure and suggestions for the kinds of complications typical for such a job. \\n\\n Such complications can be introduced as Escalate the Sit- uation Consequences you can employ as appropriate plot twists when the PCs roll a miss or fail to address a Threat that represent such an impending eventuality. You could also introduce them as pre-planned twists, rather than on- the-spot Consequences. The choice of which complications to introduce will set the feel and atmosphere of a job. \\n ABDUCTION/EXTRACTION/HIJACKING \\n\\n Snatching a person or vehicle in transit or from a secure facility, or otherwise removing someone discreetly. These types of jobs are similar to heists, in that they require planning and careful execution, but often mid-mission things become more openly violent, when “now get away alive” becomes the main goal. \\n COMPLICATIONS \\n\\n • The crew gets spotted, leaves a trace, or otherwise causes the alert level of the opposing organization to increase (alert-1 to all units) until a Limit is maxed and the organization is spurred to take action against the crew. • The target escapes the seizing attempt, leading to a chase scene. • The person who appeared to be the target is actually someone else in disguise. • The target reveals new information that puts a spin on the entire job. \\n ACQUISITION (STEALING) \\n\\n These jobs are often modeled after heists or cons. Scout the place (or the mark), come up with a plan of attack, get in (or maneuver the mark into position), get the loot, get out. \\n COMPLICATIONS \\n\\n • The crew comes into contact with another team or an insider who is pulling the same job. • Security was recently beefed up, and there are more checkpoints or obstacles than first thought. • The target item was swapped for a fake, or isn’t what was first thought (the prototype doesn’t even exist yet, or it was all a ruse). \\n ASSAULT/RAZE/ASSASSINATION/ SHUTDOWN \\n\\n Taking care of a “problem” by any means necessary is pretty straightforward. Because the foundation is simple there’s more room for complex motives and emotions, and to present ethical issues. \\n COMPLICATIONS \\n\\n • The target is a fellow professional merc, or there are innocent people around. • The target location turns out to be a Thin Place or other dangerous site. • The crew’s employer betrays them after the job (to “tie up loose ends”) or the exit strategy doesn’t pan out, leading to a “get out of here before it all blows up” scene. \\n BROKERING \\n\\n While difficult negotiations are often made under constant threats of violence, usually both sides have a lot to lose in an all-out war. Both sides can get away with a lot of she- nanigans – spying, manipulating, undermining – as long as they keep it just below the escalation threshold. \\n COMPLICATIONS \\n\\n • The object at the center of the diplomatic talks gets stolen, taken over by rivals, or otherwise compromised. • One of the parties of the negotiation is revealed to be controlled by a dangerous outside party (such as an AI, demigod, or intelligent Relic), leading them to take drastic actions. \\n\\n Designing a Series \\n • A third party inserts themselves into the situation, possibly with guns blazing. \\n | \\n\\n 285 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n CORPORATE ESPIONAGE/DISINFORMATION RITUAL PERFORMANCE \\n\\n Sneaking around and dealing with high level corp business. Lots of cyberspace scenes, secrets revealed, and possibly more elaborated social engineering schemes on a district scale. The enacting of a magical rite could simply be a protection job, if it’s an NPC performing the ritual, or the crew might be asked to perform it (perhaps due to their connection to a Source or experience in the matter). Either way, they should be on the lookout for disruptions, which therefore form the bulk of your complications. \\n COMPLICATIONS \\n\\n • A deadly (but cool-looking) recently-installed anti-in- trusion software or Harnessed protector comes online. • The corporate structure changes unexpectedly, and the execs or middle-managers the crew were planning to target are no longer in play, authority and access are being moved around. • The secrets acquired were planted fabrications or traps, and opening them installs something wicked on the crew’s devices. \\n EXORCISM \\n\\n Removing harmful spirits from a person or place usually requires ritually cleansing taint or fighting spirits using magic, probably both. It’s common for the final scene to revolve around a magical fight, but first the crew will probably study their target and its weaknesses, and face off with people who would rather keep things as they are. \\n COMPLICATIONS \\n\\n • What appeared to be a localized threat turns out to be the harbinger of something much more powerful or widespread. • The taint in the area has drawn cultists or dangerous creatures of a different Mythos. • The cleansing spell backfires, placing a crew member in a delicate situation (become ethereal, falling into a different dimension, their gear gains sentience, etc.). \\n INVESTIGATION \\n\\n COMPLICATIONS \\n\\n • A clue the crew expects to find is missing, due to a cover up or some sort of natural or supernatural decay. • The case goes a lot deeper than first thought, putting the crew in the sights of someone powerful in the Megacity. • A clue is itself dangerous to handle, or leads somewhere the PCs would rather not go (enemy territory, a company managed by an ex, back to a betraying employer, etc.). \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Looking into strange occurrences or solving crimes. Chasing clues is one thing, but confronting the corporate overlords, corrupt politicians, and Source-touched suspects is a dif- ferent thing altogether. \\n\\n 286 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n COMPLICATIONS \\n\\n • A distracting element such as severe weather changes, holiday fireworks, a gang war or the like make things difficult during the ritual, which cannot be moved to a different place or postponed. • One stage of the ritual can be greatly hastened by or demands a serious sacrifice, such as a lung, a memory, or a future. • The ritual does something other than was advertised, perhaps summoning a big Challenge. \\n SCOUTING URBAN WILDS \\n\\n This could be a scrounging job, searching for good loot or a useful location, or it could be about mapping an area. It’s also one of the few types of jobs players might take the initiative on – the wilds are always there, and there’s always treasure waiting. \\n COMPLICATIONS \\n\\n • The crew comes upon a rival group of scavengers or other dangerous locals, who are suspicious and quick to attack or escape (with valuable information). • The crew gets lost, or gets ambushed by a violent creature twisted by tech or a Source, crawling out of the refuse and rubble. • The crew stumble upon out-of-control technology or wan- der into an unmarked killzone, surrounded by explosives, brainwave scrubbers, invisible radiation, or the like. \\n SECURITY DETAIL/PATROL \\n\\n A typical guard mission usually starts out straightforward until you start causing problems for the crew. \\n COMPLICATIONS \\n\\n • The enemy was more prepared than first thought: a bomb explodes in a vulnerable position or a traitor reveals themselves at the worst time. • Things go wrong with the site or item being guarded, turning it dangerous (the item is explosive or delicate, old protocols activate, infrastructure is crumbling down, etc.). • The person being guarded escapes, defecting to a rival of the crew’s employer. \\n SOURCE-HUNTING \\n\\n One part lore and exploration, one part violent competition to get to the target item or site. The Source is usually dan- gerous and must be made safe before it can be contained or transported, perhaps existing within a Thin Place, protected by a convoluted supernatural scenario. \\n COMPLICATIONS \\n\\n • The Source manifests a guardian at an inopportune time, who fights against the crew or alongside them (yet causes mayhem). • A rival team shows up to take the Source at the last minute, and they have tools to neutralize its powers. • The Source or the neutralizing method used by the crew interacts with one of the PC’s Mythos themes in unexpected ways. \\n TRANSPORT \\n\\n Similar to a Security Detail/Patrol job, but on the move, meaning the challenges (and Challenges) can be quite different. In some cases the crew could be really stealthy about it, in others it’s a frantic run to the finish line. \\n COMPLICATIONS \\n\\n • Travel problems ensue (heavy traffic, a flat tire, police blockades or inspections, etc.). • The item or person being transported starts behaving strangely (magical effects, cybernetic glitches, etc.). • Rivals or enemies have set up an ambush ahead of the planned route.',\n",
       " 'DESIGNING A JOB -  - THE OVER-PREPARING PLAYER': 'DESIGNING A JOB\\n\\n\\nTHE OVER-PREPARING PLAYER\\n\\n\\n The missions that an :Otherscape crew might get sent on follow a few similar formats: They tend to be either break-ins, explorations/ investigations, or attempts to protect something. \\n\\n The settings, the opposition and the twists all change, but the same underlying skeleton is usually present. When you create break-ins, take inspiration from heists and espionage movie tropes. For investigation jobs, look for tropes of noir detective stories and TV cop procedurals. Protection jobs have unique pacing, with tension rising and falling when danger appears or a complication happens, then usually resolves quickly. With these inspirations in mind, let’s discuss the fundamentals of those kinds of stories. \\n WHAT’S IN A JOB? \\n\\n A job begins with hooks to pull your crew in, a specific goal they are trying to achieve, a series of scenes in which the crew faces Challenges, and hopefully a satisfying climax near the end. Finally, a job has what writers call a denoue- ment – a sort of aftermath to the narrative in which the fallout of the main characters’ actions is revealed, and consequences are determined. \\n STEP 1: CHOOSE A STARTING POINT \\n\\n A job always has a concept (what is it about), job type (its structure), and details (who and what is involved and how). When you begin to create a job, you’ll already have one of these three things. Start with that, and develop further until you have all three. Here’s how you do it. \\n STARTING WITH A DETAIL \\n\\n A detail is any specific thing in the game world. Here are some examples of details that might inspire you to develop a job: • A PC’s themes, such as their motivations, gear, or NPC connections • A plot hook left dangling from a previous job \\n\\n Designing a Series \\n • An interesting location, such as a rope bridge or an underground clone lab • A cool scene, like a chase or a tense poker game • A Mythos, or a cultural phenomena, such as a stream- ing challenge • A fun sci-fi gadget, or an unusual Source • A Challenge that you’d like to run \\n | \\n\\n 287 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Imagine a few more details around the idea you already have. Answer these questions: • What does it look like? • Where in the Megacity might this be happening? • What sort of people are around, or might be interested in it? • If one of the PCs engages with it, what might happen? Don’t try to come up with full, unique, and elaborate de- scriptions. Instead, just try to widen the angle around the first detail and write down what naturally comes up. Give the detail some context relating to your game, and your Megacity. Continue thinking about who or what might be involved, and in what ways. Consider what happened before, and what might happen after. • Let’s start with a rope bridge, because I want a scene where the PCs cross it. The bridge leads to a Thin Place. There’s a hydra there, because I like hydras. • A new AR headset is becoming commonplace in a district in the Megacity, because I like AR. The company behind it is from the Troubled Past of one of the PCs. Once in a while rethink one detail, turning it on its head. Instead of connecting it like it naturally would, decide on an unexpected twist, subvert the obvious. The hydra is not from this Thin Place, it’s from a different Mythos! It’s trapped there! The headset is dangerous… but not because of the company! A rogue AI is using it for its own needs. Your goal is to eventually arrive at one or two of the job types. At one point it will click, and you will say: • The PCs need to release the hydra, and deliver it back to its master. It’s a Ritual Performance, or maybe Transport. • Now continue to Step 2: Connecting the Parts (page 289). \\n STARTING WITH A JOB TYPE \\n\\n You know what sort of action you’re going to put in the PCs’ way, you’re just not sure about the details. So let’s develop some. Start with the most obvious thing: What is at stake? What is the job about? Use what you know about the Megacity, the PCs, the series’ Key Players and their previous jobs, to come up with an answer. Let yourself be inspired by the thematic pillars in Chapter 1: //IMAGINE. \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n • The PCs are hired by people from the district. They might infiltrate the company, but eventually follow clues to the AI. It’s an Investigation, or maybe Corporation Espionage. \\n\\n 288 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n The answer doesn’t need to be interesting, it just needs to exist. However, later on we’ll want to add a twist to the job, and that could already happen at this stage. Consider subverting the obvious, so that the PCs find the job develops unlike what they were expecting. • Abduction/Assasination/Extraction/Hijacking: An old acquaintance; a previous employer; a person con- nected to a previous target; a friend in need; someone who got in debt with the wrong people; etc. Subverted example: One of the PCs is sent to infiltrate a place, then needs to be extracted themselves. • Acquisition: A Source or weapon that has been discussed before; something that could be useful to a known Key Player; something that might change society for better or worse; etc. Subverted example: The item was stolen by others before the crew arrived, and now needs to be stolen from those guys. • Assault/Raze/Shutdown: Someone wants to harm a competitor; someone needs a loud noise to distract from their actual dealings; etc. Subverted example: The target is nothing like what the briefing said, and innocents (or the crew) are at great risk. • Brokering: Trying to stop a war or prevent it; someone wants to maintain secrecy so they send the PCs in their name; the PCs are drawn to an auction because something that interests them is offered, etc. Subverted example: Someone wants something the PCs acquired and sends a negotiator to them. • Corporate Espionage/Disinformation: A Key Player wants to know about another Key Player’s dealings with- out raising suspicion; or they want to subtly sabotage the decision making process of another Key Player; etc. Subverted example: The crew’s job itself is based on misinformation and the data they’re stealing is a dud, meant only to prove to the rival that their own misin- formation campaign was successful. • Exorcism: A Source goes out of control; a Mythical Con- juration needs to be cleared from a specific place; etc. Subverted example: One of the PCs’ Sources is re- vealed to be cursed and needs to be cleansed. • Investigation: An unexplained event needs to be un- derstood; a killer needs to be found; etc. Subverted example: The crew is pulled out of a case mid- job, leading them to investigate their own employer. • Ritual Performance: A disaster will happen if the ritual is not complete; the items required for the ritual are hard to get or require a sacrifice; etc. Subverted example: The ritual requires the Sources of the PCs themselves, they’re being duped into partici- pating but are in fact about to be sacrificed. • Scouting Urban Wilds: There are persistent rumors of a treasure cache that vibes well with a PC’s motiva- tion; someone needs to establish a trail through the wilds; a PC’s Source or contacts needs them to find a specific place; etc. Subverted example: The crew is kidnapped to a remote enclave and now must escape through the wilds while being chased. • Security Detail/Patrol: Someone or something might attack an important place soon; a barrier kept by the PCs’ organization or contacts must be guarded and it’s the crew’s turn to do it; etc. Subverted example: While the PCs are on guard, some- thing is obviously going wrong with the thing they need to guard, but the danger isn’t coming from outside. • Source-hunting: A Source makes itself known in a district and someone wants it; a Source is suspected as being in a dangerous location and the employer wants it; etc. Subverted example: A group of mercs come after the crew, because someone wants one of their Sources. • Transport: A unique or delicate device, or a sealed high- ly-reactive substance or contaminator, needs to be moved to a secure location or be disposed of; a VIP needs to be carried in secret through a dangerous or public zone; etc. Subverted example: The PCs find themselves on a bus that can’t stop moving or it’ll explode, along with some of their closest allies. Now that you know the reason for the job, develop it further by adding details. Imagine the core moments of the job – such as when the building explodes, when the item is taken from the safe, or when the Source is revealed – and ask yourself: • Where is this happening? What district, what’s the atmo- sphere, is it on the street, in a room, in a vault, on a roof? • What else is here? Drones, Sources, debris, discarded cargo boxes? Consider what happened before that led to this point, and what might happen after. Think about who is involved in Your goal is to have enough details so you can imagine a mostly-intact scene or two, knowing where it happens, what’s happening in it, and what it looks like. Now continue to Step 2: Connecting the Parts (see below). \\n STARTING WITH A CONCEPT \\n\\n You have a big idea. Maybe you want to place the players in an ethically ambiguous situation, or you want to put an emphasis on one of the thematic pillars from Chapter 1: //Imagine. Your first step should be finding an appropriate job type. It doesn’t have to perfectly fit, but it should be at least vaguely in the same area. For example, if you want to have your players face some- thing along the lines of The Trolley Problem, you need to put some innocent lives at stake. This happens naturally in many Assault jobs, so that’s your go-to. You can consider Transport as well (perhaps with a literal cyber-trolley), or even Exorcism, because possessed people might be in danger, or the Source that is meant to be exorcized might be beneficial to some, making it into a morally gray situation. Now go back to Starting With a Job Type (page 288), and start down that path. As you do, however, keep in mind the concept. Make choices based on what can help, or at least not hinder, the big idea you’re trying to convey. For example, if you want to emphasize that in the cruel future world of the Megacity everyone is essentially alone, avoid putting allies in the picture even if the crew knows some people that will be good to have around. Place the scene somewhere that’s remote or cut off from commu- nications, so that the crew will have trouble calling for aid. \\n STEP 2: CONNECT THE PARTS \\n\\n You should now have a good idea around a job type or two, a few basic scenes, and possibly a concept. If you’re missing a concept, consider deciding on one now. The most memorable and entertaining role-playing scenarios are those that feel like a coherent whole, based on an overarching theme. It doesn’t need to be sophisticated; in fact, simple works best. Look at your series concept (Series – Step 1: Choose a Series Concept, page 146) for inspiration, and consider :Otherscapes’ thematic pillars, a theme fitting a Key Player, or general life lessons such as “The enemy of my enemy is my friend”. Your next step is to expand out by adding scenes and details. Because :Otherscape is a cinematic role-playing game, you shouldn’t create a linear narrative. You don’t know what the \\n\\n Designing a Series \\n • Who is here? Famous foes, surprising allies, bystanders, a wise old owl? the bigger picture, who is the employer, who stands in opposition, what third parties or victims might be involved. \\n | \\n\\n 289 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n players will choose to do, how they might surprise you, and where the action will lead. Instead, you will come up with several core moments you want to see happening, and choose vectors for your Key Players, the direction they want to head to and the force with which they do it. \\n CORE MOMENTS \\n\\n During Step 1 you created one or more core moments, events that seem cool or interesting to you. You can’t control how they’ll develop – you’ll only know during the game. You can use your Threats and Consequences to direct the action toward an ending that you especially like, but the player actions and the dice share the power and responsibility of creating what will actually happen. A core moment should be prepared as a situation that is ready to go. Prepare enough before the game so you can set the scene, give the atmospheric notes, decide which story tags are around, know which NPCs are here and what they want to do. Then let the players in, and see what happens. \\n\\n Example: If you want a fight against a hydra while half the crew is busy doing a binding ritual, you need to decide what the area looks like (a shadowy temple), which atmospheric cues to give (hydra roars, mice and bat droppings), what story tags can enrich this scene, and what will be required of the ritual (lightning up three brasiers around the room). You also need a Challenge for the hydra, and maybe for the ritual as well, but that’s getting deeper into rules, we’ll do that in Step 3. \\n Vectors always have a face. The person who hired the crew to bring back the hydra isn’t just a blank entity, they must be someone. They could be a lieutenant in a cult of a Greek mythology Source, from which the hydra was stolen or per- haps the owner of a zoo of mythical creatures, who wants to trap the hydra. Even if the main foe is “Megacorp International”, the com- pany is not itself the vector. Someone in the company is in charge of this operation, or cares about this subject, or screwed up in a way that led to the job happening. Give them a name, and for now assume they have access to much of their company’s resources. Later, we’ll get back to this. The exception to the rule are vectors that represent time running out. These are elements that are not thinking agents, but still have a “want” and “push” toward some- thing: the flood is about to arrive in eight hours; the curse is getting stronger; the disease is progressing, the Thin Place will close when the clock chimes twelve, etc. \\n VECTORS \\n\\n Vectors represent every major force in the job. They tell you what that force wants and how bad they want it, and they prov de a guide when you need to: \\n BUILD THE SKELETON \\n\\n You have a few basic scenes now, but eventually you need a starting scene, one or two follow-ups, all of your core moments, and a finale. • Figure out what will bring the crew into this situation To achieve those, ask yourself what happens before and after each of your core moments. You now need to find a reason for why the core moments happen, and the answer should usually be one or more vectors. Someone pushed for this to happen, or pushed for something else and failed, which led to this moment. Change the vector’s want, push, or face (or the core moments) until they fit. If you can’t find a “someone” – make one up. Create a vector to explain this, see the notes on this below. • Figure out what will happen when the situation ends in an unexpected way • Choose which Consequences to use during the game, so you won’t push too far beyond your preparation (unless you want to) To define a vector, think about the participating forces who have a say in the job, both in front of and behind the scenes. These could be series Key Players or other players local to the job, and you should already have some ideas, thanks to Step 1. A vector has a want, which is something they are trying to achieve in this scenario, and a push, which is the resources they are able and willing to put forward to achieve their want. The employer, if there is one, is always a vector. The crew is never a vector – they’re the unknown variable. \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Describe your main vectors, and define a want and a push for each. This helps you decide how to plan out the rest of the job, but it’s also useful during the game, as a limit on your own MC power. Nothing prevents you from using a Consequence to introduce an Avatar into the scene, or suddenly bring back a dead foe from two jobs ago. But should you? Does any vector have the want AND the push to do so? If not, then maybe it shouldn’t happen. When you let your vectors guide you, you stay within the confines of what you yourself decided is best for this job. \\n\\n 290 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Example: Imagine it’s a heist job, and you want there to be a shootout on the rooftops in the rain. Who’s the vector that made it happen? How about there’s a second crew go- ing for the same loot. They want to get the loot, and they are willing to push by going into a direct confrontation, although, being thieves, they prefer an ambush. If the crew allows the loot to fall into the hand of these thieves, the PCs will get a chance to chase after the thieves and a firefight ensues on the rooftops; if the PCs get the loot first, the thieves will try to set an ambush on their escape route. \\n To refine your vectors, especially if you’re feeling they’re too strong or weak, consider delegating power. Go one or more steps up or down the hierarchy of a Key Player, and reconsider the vector. Perhaps it’s not the CEO of global megacorp GenePool who is trying to personally steal the Source guarded by the crew, but a local executive, or even a subsidiary who can use some of GenePool’s resources, but not all. Or maybe it’s not a lone grave robber who woke up the ghost who haunts the VR Domain, and she’s in fact part of The Gordian (page 52), and unearthed the ghost by mistake while establishing a private node. Let your vectors guide you naturally back and forth along the timeline until you reach a point where the PCs should intervene, as befitting the job type. In some jobs, such as Investigations and Brokering, a lot has happened before the crew arrives. In others, maybe there’s barely any background to consider, such as with straightforward Assault or Transport. If the job seems too simple or straightforward to your taste, an easy trick is to daisy chain job types, also nicknamed a “sausage link”. Just add a job type of a different kind before or after the current one, turning it into a more prolonged and complex situation. Come up with at least one core moment for each job type, then link them in any way that fits you best, not forgetting to rewrite vectors if needed. Always remember – you don’t know what will happen. Prepare your core moments and know your vectors, so you can improvise during the play. A job’s starting scene will likely begin in the headquarters or usual hangout of the crew, though it could also get started at an abandoned parking garage, noisy nightclub, or other gritty location. By default, this is when the crew gets the details of the mission, and afterward they are free to research the situation and prepare themselves. This is probably what your players expect, so be careful with dropping them into a job without giving them any preparation time. The natural follow ups are “snooping around” scenes. The PCs will probably want to hit the streets and roll some dice to gather what leads they can, piece together a basic plan, and get Loaded Up. This is true even outside of traditionally clue-heavy scenarios: Information is power, knowing your enemy is crucial, and getting the right floor schematics or access key is a must. This part might be a montage, during which each PC goes off on their own side task to gather intel. Alternatively it could be wrapped with a few Quick rolls, with the players obtain- ing or paying for information. You can also use Flashbacks and the Prep Sequence to jump into the action and play through preparation in hindsight. Most likely you’ll want to use different combinations of these two approaches, de- pending on the job. See Intel Gathering in the supplement :Otherscape Action Database for suggestions. The finale should raise the tension to the max. In many jobs, this could be a boss fight, but in others this might be an escape from some unwanted situation; crews have a tendency to get into dangerous places. The escape can take up an entire scene at the end of the job, serving as the climax of the story. Fleeing through corridors as mobs of guards arrive, carefully exfiltrating so as not to set off the alarms, or desperately trying to shake their pursuers in a vehicular chase can all be quite tense and rewarding once the scene is over. \\n\\n Designing a Series \\n Example: Imagine a job that starts as an Acquisition of a black crate. During a fire- fight, the crate accidently opens and re- veals a person in a coma. They wake up, and use strange magic to try and escape into the sub-basements or the streets outside, turning this into an Extraction or possibly Investigation job (if they managed to es- cape). The employer claims the target is a dangerous person, but a different Key Player enters the scene and claims the target is a victim. Once the crew has the target, the job then turns into Brokering between the two parties, finally culminating in a Ritu- al to release the target – who is in fact a magical being – back into their Thin Place. \\n PREPARE THE SCENES \\n\\n The sites surrounding core moments, such as the secret lab where a heist will happen, a submarine in a hijacking job, or the scene of the crime in an investigation, should all be chosen in advance. In cinema, big detailed sets that serve as backdrops to action scenes are called “set pieces”. Major action scenes should be built around set pieces that showcase your job’s concept: A job that focuses on corporate corrup- tion and cutthroat politics could have set piece locations at corporate suite plazas filled with expensive urban art. A job about gang turf warfare could feature scenes in the docks and the dirty corridors of condemned tenement buildings. \\n | \\n\\n 291 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n STEP 3: GET INTO THE RULES \\n\\n It’s time to go over your scenes and vectors and decide what tags to put in, and what to turn into a Challenge. \\n SELECTING ADVERSARIES \\n\\n Only a few of the people encountered during a scene need to have complete Challenges Profile (page 97). Some could just be represented by a tag or two, or a simple Limit like convince if you want the players to engage them with a tracked outcome. Most of the time, the average NPC is just a story element to interact with narratively, rather than mechanically. It’s best to mix and match types of obstacles, inspired by the three categories of PC themes: Self, Mythic, and Noise. If one scene has cybered goons with a hacker leader, the next should have something Mythic going on. It could be a Source-touched tiger, but it could also be a magical ward on a safe’s door, or a poltergeist making things difficult while looking for clues. The scene after that could have a conversation with a supplier who unknowingly helps the bad guys, and could perhaps be convinced to betray them. The Challenges you’re most likely to need are common thugs, drones, and other frontliners. These guards and miscreants are there to add a little action to scenes that need it, or when a good fight would make sense. It can be fun to spice up a battle against simple combatants with a more powerful leader or specialist. This is where Power Sets come in: just stack one onto a typical Challenge and you’ve got yourself a standout foe. \\n OTHER CHALLENGES \\n\\n If your job features an exciting moment that could end badly for the crew, it might be worth making it into a Challenge. By giving it Threats, Consequences, and Limits, you make it more pronounced. \\n STEP 4: WRAP UP \\n\\n Look through your notes, and check to see if anyone backstabs anyone else. Can’t see any betrayal? Maybe add one. This is far from required, but cyberpunk is known for being deeply cynical and lacking in trust – at least once in a while someone should \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Even minor jobs should have somewhat more powerful foes to battle at the climax. Think in terms of cool signature attacks in the form of Consequences for your villain, but also consider the importance of Threats that articulate the villain’s character. A memorable villain chews the scenery, laying out their plan between PC spotlights or engaging in the villainous behavior that inspires dread and hatred from the crew. \\n\\n 292 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n betray someone. This might be part of a cold-hearted plan, but perhaps it isn’t, with the betrayer choosing to go down this path at the spur of the moment due to a personal failing. \\n HOOKS \\n\\n Now that you know your job, go back to the beginning to create story hooks that make sure both players and their characters would be interested in running it. A job could begin with a literal job offer, a meeting with the crew’s primary work contact (handler, mentor, etc.), or a coinciden- tal series of events out on the street. It could fall into the group’s lap naturally, due to a friend in need or a neighbor who has seen something suspicious. The crew could rely on a merc job app, or a privateer-to-employer match making service. The most memorable jobs will be ones that tie in with the specific backstories of the members of the crew, often associated with one of their themes. Keep in mind that when an Identity, Ritual, or Itch is challenged, the player may wish to engage with the job just to keep their character’s connection to their themes. \\n DENOUEMENT & AFTERMATH \\n\\n Once the crew get away, retrieve the artifact, or otherwise complete the mission there should be a moment of reflection on what just happened, a denouement. In :Otherscape, these moments tend to integrate into the character’s evolution. As you talk through what each PC feels and experiences after the end of the job, think about potential mechanical implications as well. Does a PC lose touch with one of their themes? Does the crew theme mark an upgrade box? Is it time for a story tag or a status to expire? Remember to Load Off before you head into a downtime. Finally, most jobs end up with some great big consequenc- es that will need to be summed up in an aftermath. If a research facility implodes, a bad guy gets thrown in prison, or a neighborhood is cleansed of a demonic presence, all these things could have an impact on the Megacity, par- ticularly in the world that surrounds the crew. Is someone now looking for revenge? Are new opportunities await? What is different in the Megacity, or in the crew’s lives? You can prepare for the aftermath by writing some questions beforehand, focusing on the repercussions of the success or failure of each stage, and survival or destruction of various elements in the narrative. Simply by thinking about the questions you might realize some moments in the job are too dull and need to be spiced up, or that some scenes are over-complicated and maybe can be separated into parts. \\n REWARDS \\n\\n The rewards for a completed job are first and foremost narrative – a nefarious plan has been foiled, a hated foe destroyed, the crew escaped alive. During the job, PCs also gain upgrades and replace themes and gain Evolution, as explained under Character Evolution (page 140). The most common reward is cash. You can give the crew a status representing elevated solvency – how much cash they can spend relative to their general wealth level – such as flush, lots-to-spend, or rolling-in-it, based on how deep the employer’s pockets are and the nature of the job. Another game reward PCs can gain is represented by loot catalogs: access to certain special items that their em- ployers possess, or that they stole, salvaged, or otherwise acquired from the job site. New additions to the catalog are often very exciting for players, who love getting the option of trying out new toys on their next job! Items in a loot catalog include a list of individual tags represent- ing the most valuable, important, or interesting items found in a cache. For key items, it can include more tags representing additional features of the item, as well as weakness tags, turning the item into a set of tags. A loot catalog can include any number of such items, or copies of the same item. You as the MC rule which items are immediately ready for use (as story tags or unburnt loadout tags) and which require maintenance or time to properly activate (burnt loadout tags). See Adding Tags To The Loadout Theme, page 116. Don’t be afraid of handing out even seemingly powerful catalog items, because they can always be burned during a job by Consequences. They might also be held back from Loading Up by circumstances: Nothing is forever, especially not in the Megacity, and the Loadout subchapter (page 114) already warns that even common items might be hard to get in a Loading Up moment under certain conditions. A supplier might disappear, a source might run dry, or maybe the crew is just too far away from where the batteries are kept. Maybe a powerful item simply broke, and needs to be repaired – that could be a great reason to go on a new job. Another powerful reward can be information. If the crew has been chasing the CEO of a hated megacorporation for several jobs, and finally get to learn their true name, this is a huge win on their part – now they can take the initiative, and plan their next job themselves. \\n MODUS',\n",
       " 'DESIGNING A JOB': 'DESIGNING A JOB\\n\\n\\nOPERANDI: STEALTH VS. GUNS BLAZING \\n\\n There are two play styles that will come up often in :Otherscape jobs. It’s really a decision of how to proceed in the world, a modus operandi. Does the crew engage mostly in stealth, subtlety, diplomacy, and other careful tactics? Or do they go in ready to fight, get intimidat- ing, and openly hostile to potential foes? This is a big decision that can really impact the tone of your game, as well as the kinds of stories you tell. The group’s choice of crew type (page 154) as well as the players’ choice of power tags helps put everyone on the same page. While the crew as a whole should be oriented toward a specific play style, it can be fun if a character or two are on the fringes. That is to say, in a group that likes to do things carefully and quietly it can be interesting to have a member who flies off the handle once in a while. That’s a great potential for drama and ac- tion… as long as the other players don’t feel like this character is ruining their plan or their fun.

For example: • This ravine is very wide, so crossing it isn’t certain and is certainly dramatic.

I’ll create the progress Limit collapse:5, and start giving collapsing-1 as Consequences. • That chimera drone is supposed to be pretty mean, I guess it can do a bitten-2 or slashed-2 as a Consequence. • The core is burning very hot, so whenever they hit it, they also get burned-3 which they can’t mitigate.

Anything can potentially be an obstacle to the crew or their goals: hostile or volatile characters are an obvious threat be- cause they might hurt the PCs, but friendly or innocent characters can also pose an obstacle because the PCs might try to protect them. For example, a little girl with a toy that is a Source of Armageddon could be completely innocent, but still pose a threat to the Megacity; or the apparition that has been guiding the crew through the entire season can deal Consequences to influence them to follow its advice and abandon other aspects of their lives, etc. For a list of Challenge types, see Step 1: Start With The Role Or Features, page 297. \\n\\n 296 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " 'CREATING CHALLENGE PROFILES': \"CREATING CHALLENGE PROFILES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Creating custom-made Challenges for your jobs is not only a lot of fun, it also helps you present a cohesive story that matches your series concept. Follow the steps below to create your own Challenges. \\n\\n STEP 1: START WITH THE ROLE OR FEATURES \\n\\n Each Challenge has a role, determining what it’s meant to do. Some classic roles are presented as follows. • Asset: Someone or something that the PCs must defend from other forces.An Autumn Elemental that needs escorting through the sewers. • Attacker: Someone who wants to hurt the PCs, physically, mentally, socially, etc.A group of corp hired guns who crash through the safehouse’s window. • Barrier or Hazard: An obstacle that is in the path of the PCs. The safe door to a vault. • Countdown: Something that will happen in a few moments or that advances towards a crescendo. The rising water level in the sewer tunnel will soon make everyone drown. • Mystery: Something the PCs want to find out, but is not evident and may even be hidden from them. A secret code is hiding in the VR Domain, disguised as part of the scenery. • Pursuer: Someone who is chasing the PCs down. A spi- der-drone chasing after the PCs escaping from the scene. • Target: Someone or something that the PCs need, but is getting away. A fleeing armored hovercraft prototype the PCs are trying to capture. • Watcher: Someone or something that is patrolling, looking for the PCs, watching the PCs, or trying to assess their true intentions. The Star Child that is visiting the PCs in their dreams, trying to learn about them. Ask yourself: FOR WHAT PURPOSE IS THIS CHALLENGE GOING TO BE USED? WHAT DO I NEED IT TO DO IN THE JOB? HOW DOES THIS CHALLENGE LOOK AND ACT LIKE? IS THERE SOMETHING SUPER COOL ABOUT IT? Ask some follow up questions, based on what the Challenge represents. • Character: What are this Challenge’s skills, gear, person- ality, and connections? • Creature or drone: What are its natural or designed capabilities? • Sources and Conjurations: What is the Mythos in play? What powers does it possess? • Digital construct: How does it act in the metaphor of its Domain? • Location or situation: What kinds of things make this place dangerous? What could happen next? • Target or victim: What could happen to this thing? How can it defend itself or get itself into trouble? At the end of this step, you should have a general concept for your Challenge, which we will now turn into rules. \\n EXAMPLE: CYBERNETIC K-9 UNIT CONCEPT \\n\\n Perhaps your game could use a cyberpunk version of a police K-9 dog. They could be trained dogs outfitted with advanced cyber- netics and allowed to patrol autonomously, receiving orders from dispatch. \\n\\n C r e at i n g C h a l l e n g e s \\n • Temptation: Someone or something that tries to get the PCs to act in a certain way. A persuasive underworld matriarch who wants the PCs to do her dirty work. A Challenge also has features, which consist of every in- teresting “fact” about the Challenge and its various parts. The Challenge can fill its role thanks to its features, and vice versa: its features determine which role its best suited for. The features are also what you describe to the players, what the Challenge looks and sounds like, what it carries and how it moves. \\n | \\n\\n 297 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n STEP 2: DEFINE LIMITS \\n\\n Create the Challenge’s Limits by considering the following questions. A Challenge must have at least one Limit, a way for it to be overcome or a progress it measures. Ask: HOW CAN THIS CHALLENGE BE OVERCOME? WHAT STA- TUSES CAN BRING IT TO AN END? Each possible way to defeat this Challenge is a Limit. For each Limit, set a maximum between 2 and 6 which is the tier of relevant statuses required to max it out (Tier 1 Limits are effectively one-shot Limits; most Challenges that could be overcome with any single successful action should instead be resolved with a Quick outcome). Tier 2 indicates it is easy to overcome the Challenge in this way, while Tier 6 means it’s incredibly difficult. See a list of common Limit options under Overcoming Challenges (page 107), and more in-depth under each category in the Action Database. \\n IMMUNITIES \\n\\n If a Challenge is immune to something, and can never be brought down by that type of activity, give it a Limit of “–”. \\n PROGRESS LIMITS \\n\\n You can also ask: WHAT DANGEROUS TRANSFORMATION OR END IS THIS CHALLENGE MOVING TOWARD? The answer is one or more progress Limits. When these Limits max out, the Challenge will transform into some- thing else (“stage 2” robot attack mode; the cybered brute becomes homicidal; etc.) or something bad happens (the virus finishes uploading; the ritual is complete; etc.). \\n EXAMPLE: CYBERNETIC K-9 UNIT LIMITS \\n\\n It should also have a Limit for when someone tries to hack into its cybernetic systems, so let’s give it a take-over Limit to repre- sent this. The tier here represents how much expertise and time is needed to override the unit’s systems. With the K-9 unit being set up to resist street-variety hacking, but not much more, let's set that Limit to 3 as well. \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Our cybernetic K-9 unit should have a hurt- or-subdue Limit, just as most combat capable Challenges might. Let’s set that Limit at 3, since it’s a small adversary, but a bit tough. 298 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Finally, the K-9 cyborg should have a prog- ress Limit that represents how close it is to tracking a suspect that it’s been sent against. Maybe call this one tracked-down:4. This Challenge could add statuses to this Limit to get closer to finding its target. \\n STEP 3: CREATE BASE TAGS & STATUSES \\n\\n A Challenge’s base tags are the story tags and statuses it has by default. These represent what a person or a crea- ture would consider normal for themselves, or in case of a situation, what the starting conditions are. Ask: WHAT FEATURES OF THIS CHALLENGE GIVE IT AN EX- TRA KICK? An armored robot could have heavy armor, and a tank might also have thick plating. A mystical Thin Place that is difficult for the mind to grasp can have disorienting. An energetic salesman might have energetic-2. Not every characteristic or piece of gear needs to be rep- resented by tags, though. A bunch of goons all obviously have guns, but there’s no need to give them a tag for that. Remember, story tags and statues only exist for things that are interesting, rather than listing inventory. Providing a Challenge with base tags and statuses is es- sentially like “arming” it in preparation for the crew, making sure they appear in the scene with everything they should have in order for the rules to reflect what they’re about. More specifically, Challenge tags and statuses make things easier or harder for the crew by affecting the player’s roll, whether actions or mitigating reactions, rather than affect- ing the Challenge’s Consequences. A body armor tag makes attacks against the Challenge harder, an armor piercing tag makes mitigating the Challenge’s attacks harder, while an alert-2 status makes deceiving or sneaking by the Challenge quite a bit harder. \\n EXAMPLE: CYBERNETIC K-9 UNIT TAGS \\n\\n Our K-9 unit should have a few statuses and tags to represent the baseline capabilities its hardware enables. It could have subder- mal plates and olfactory enhancements, both as story tags since they represent special capabilities that the Challenge’s cybernet- ics provide. It could also have firewalled-2, because the police won’t just leave the dog’s cybernetic’s radio open for all. Fi- nally, it could have programmed-loyalty-3, representing its resistance to commands that would defy its masters. \\n STEP 4: CHOOSE CONSEQUENCES AND SPECIALS \\n\\n A Challenge’s Consequences and Specials determine the most important things about it, because through them you’ll create the actual experience for the players facing the Challenge. Ask: IN WHICH WAYS WILL THIS CHALLENGE INTERACT WITH THE PLAYER CHARACTERS? Create the Challenge’s Consequences by considering these questions: • How can this Challenge influence or hurt others, if the crew lets it? • How can this Challenge help itself or its allies, if the crew lets it? • How does this Challenge affect the scene or advance its goals, if the crew lets it? List a few short descriptions of actions the Challenge can take and the Consequences associated with each, which could be narrative, with Effects, or both. You may use a single Effect or multiple Effects, possibly targeting a single recipient or several. Consequences must be a clear description of an action happening in the story, something we could imagine as happening “on screen”, for example, create a cloud of lightning, slice with sword, tick closer to exploding. \\n EXAMPLE: CYBERNETIC K-9 UNIT CONSEQUENCES \\n\\n The K-9 cyborg Challenge should have a few Consequences for when it gets into com- bat, but also for when it’s on the scent of a “perp” putting statuses on its tracked- down:4 Limit: • Bite a target without letting go (wounded-2 and held-by-bite-3) • Pounce on someone and knock them to the ground (prone-2) • Track down a target who has been in the area recently (on-the-hunt-2) \\n • Danger Everywhere: Whenever an escalate status is taken, a random object is thrown in the PCs’ direction... (page 311) • Weak Foundations: Whenever someone (PC or Chal- lenge) takes an action that could significantly damage its structure in any way, the Crumbling Building takes collapse-1… (page 310) Other times they are meant as nasty surprises, or to force the players into an unusual situation, in which they must rethink their approach. Here are two examples from the Electricity Elemental (page 315): • Amp It Up: Electricity or energy-based statuses are considered positive for the Elemental, and do not add to its hurt-or-subdue Limit. • Feedback: When the Electricity Elemental is attacked in close quarters combat, the attacker first takes jolted-2. Specials break the normal rules, that’s their whole point, but sometimes that could lead to undesired consequences. To try and mitigate potential derailment, play the scene in your head, imagining what the players will do, what they’ll roll, and how you’ll activate the Challenge. Ask yourself: • How will this affect the mood around the table, and player choices? • Is this a form of an attack to be mitigated, or something that needs to be defeated? Or do they roll something else entirely? • How does this add up, create synergy, or clash with the Challenge's base tags, Consequences, or Limits? Finally, and it’s a big one, ask yourself: • Is this the simplest Special that will get the effect I want? It is also advisable to consider if the ability represented by the Special is obvious to the players, or if it only becomes apparent after its first use. At the very least, it should probably be hinted at in some way, or otherwise possible for a careful crew to take action and partially or fully dis- cover the Special. \\n\\n C r e at i n g C h a l l e n g e s \\n Specials are what makes a Challenge truly unique. That doesn't mean every Challenge should have them, and in fact, nine times out of ten when you come up with a cool idea for something a Challenge can do, a Limit, a Consequence or a base tag are probably the best ways to do it. Before you create a Special, first make sure you even need it. A Special has timing (when it comes into play) and an effect (what happens when it’s triggered). Most Specials are interjections, and they’re designed to make sure that something happens regardless of player actions or to make something happen in concordance with something else. For example: \\n | \\n\\n 299 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n STEP 5: CREATE THREATS \\n\\n By default, Threats and Consequences come in pairs: a Threat leading to a Consequence (or several). Standalone Threats are possible, but they’re rare, usually for when there’s no specific clear Consequence. Create the Challenge’s Threats by considering this question: HOW DOES THIS CHALLENGE TELEGRAPH THAT IT’S ABOUT TO MAKE LIFE HARDER FOR THE CREW? Threats must describe something that we can immediately imagine happening in the story, something we could imagine as happening “on screen”, for example the alarm begins blaring, pulls a gun out, shouts magic words. “Prepare to attack” is not specific enough. If you find yourself describing something the Challenge usually does, but isn’t an imminent threat, it's better to put it in the Challenge’s description and not as a Threat. It's a Threat only if it’s leading to the Challenge presenting a real obstacle to the PC’s goals. \\n EXAMPLE: CYBERNETIC K-9 UNIT CONSEQUENCES \\n\\n Our K-9 unit already has three Consequences – one for biting and holding onto a tar- get, one for knocking them down, and one for tracking a perp using its cyber and natural senses. The Threats for those Consequences could be: • Growl menacingly and slowly stalk forwards • Lean on its hydraulic hind legs as they whirr with a winding sound • Sniff the ground and activate head-mounted sensory dishes \\n STEP 6: WRAP UP \\n\\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Now it’s time to read everything again and make sure the parts fit. Perhaps you realize you’re missing a Limit, or that you have one that makes no sense. Maybe after creating the Consequences you understand you should add a new base tag. \\n\\n 300 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield.

It’s all too easy to become infected by a virus, such as by Harnessing into corrupted systems, angering the wrong hacker, or pirating cinema streams online.

A Ghost can possess someone, creating a compelling possessed status that directs the possessed person to protect the Ghost and to avoid resisting further possession. \\n\\n LIMITS \\n HURT OR SUBDUE \\n 2 \\n\\n incorporeal, invisible \\n\\n ›T H R E AT S / » C O N S E Q U E N C E S \\n Long have tiny, almost imperceptible forces meddled with machinery and meticulous work.

Their targeting systems are very simple, so approved visitors are encouraged to display their ID’s at all times, lest they be mistaken for an intruder. Some variants on the base design include the mobile turret, which has four mechanical legs; the jet turret, which is capable of short bursts of flight to relocate to better positions; and the grenade launcher, firing explosive smoke grenades inflicting shredded-3 and blinded-3. Some turrets are equipped with self-destructive protocols which trigger at wrecked-2 if someone is closeby, inflicting shredded-4 on them.

Most of these punks defy mainstream through anti-conformist music and style, occasionally committing petty crimes to “stick it to the Man.” But Abigail Bedaiko is no ordinary punk. She exposes illegal corporate activities and calls on the people of the Megacity for an armed revolution through her underground cyberspace media stream “Dausi Channel.” When it’s time to attack, she leads from the front to destroy corporate assets with an army of followers. Abigail lived all her life in the gutters, realizing that the rampant crime and unchecked poverty she was born and raised in was caused by the abuse of megacorporations. She is known in the underground with the respected title of “Jalimuso”– a West African bard and oral historian. The corporations see Abigail as an anarchist and call her “The Slaughterer”, a name she claims is part of a propaganda campaign against her, although the extremist woman has been known to take her crusade extremely seriously and ignore many red flags. Every song Abigail performs in her underground concerts or live on air is a call to action, stoking the fires of rebellion as she plays her electric guitar which is actually the Source of Gassire’s Lute, part of the Dausi, a mythological epic of the West African Wagadu. It tells of Gassire, a Wagadu prince who wanted to become king, and how his greed and vanity cost him the life of his sons, his place among his people and Wagadu itself. Like Gassire, Abigail is rash and driven by her desire for notoriety. She would kill anyone in the way of her mission without hesitation, be they the crew, innocent bystanders or her own followers. To Abigail, no price is too great for the destruction of the corporations, and if the Megacity must flow with the blood of the people, then so be it.',\n",

Twin Banks is also known for initiating hostile takeovers of all their rivals, buying out properties, and setting ludicrous interest rates which ensure thousands are plunged into debt. Arman always wears a pure black suit and is never seen without his two secretaries. They act as the CEO’s body- guards and advisors; those who hold the position always have the same personality as their boss (even if they didn’t before): cruel, silent, and malicious. In truth, the position of Arman’s secretaries is the Source of King Zahhak, the Serpent King from Zoroastrianism. Zahhak was cursed to have two snakes growing from his shoulders that demanded a constant sacrifice of brains each day. The Source blesses Arman with riches and prophecies which he uses to expand his company as long as they are satisfied. Like the snakes, the Source demands Arman to sacrifice two lives daily, which is a simple matter for a man of his position. If the crew is in need of cash, Twin Banks could approach them and offer to make the PCs solvent-3. The crew’s end of the deal is to bring in captives marked by Twin Banks, such as corporate rivals or other debtors, to be sacrificed by Arman.

In the Megacity, one of the better known ones is “The Eternal Eye”, a name that has made its way out of the dark reaches of the net and into mainstream news. No firewall can hide secrets from them, and victims of the hacker are blackmailed or find their bank accounts bled dry. No one knows who they are, and even when this elusive phantom chooses to appear, they usually do so as a figure cloaked in shadows that obscure all their features. In meatspace, the Eternal Eye is nothing more than an edgy teenager named Hayashi Nao. Nao, a genius but strange youth who was bullied in school, got sucked into various counterculture trends as a means of escape and eventually made the choice to retreat into the net. He has not moved from his bed in years, his body sustained by machines. His parents tend to his every material need, and are unaware of his robust life as one of the most infamous criminals in the Megacity. Nao cares little for money or physical comforts, driven by a desire to prove his superiority over everyone in the net. With oblivious parents and no friends to speak of, Nao knows no other way to address his pain than by using his brilliant skills – and amassed Esoteric knowledge – to bully others just as he was. Nao placed his personal cyberspace Domain in the deepest roots of the net: the Well of Ages (Source of Mimir, beheaded hoarder of secret knowledge from Norse mythology). It is a trove of information that Nao continuously uploads data to for easy access later. As the Eternal Eye, Nao acts as an information broker, selling important knowledge for the right price. He prizes the secrets of Esoterica most of all. Like Mimir bargained with Odin, he demands a sacrifice in the form of a portion of a Source’s power, whereupon the Well of Ages can replicate it. In your series, the Eternal Eye could be hired by an enemy of the PCs to dig up data on them or to sabotage their plans. Alternatively, a PC could turn to him for knowledge. He can grant an appropriate tier-2 status or a story tag describing the information the PC is seeking. In exchange, Nao burns two tags from an Esoterica themebook and gains them as story tags. \\n\\n Challenge Directory \\n | \\n\\n 323 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield.

Order #218284 \\n HUANG XIU, THE UNDYING PURSUER \\n\\n Spoken only in hushed words within merc circles, the cyborg known as the Undying Pursuer is perhaps the deadliest Source hunter in existence. Back when they were a recruit in a Source acquisition task- force, Huang was on a mission to secure a Relic known as the Elixir of Immortality, the one described in the legend of Xu Fu (the Chinese alchemist who sought the Elixir). The expedition was intercepted by a rival corporate strike team. In desperation, Huang was forced to drink the elixir so they could survive and bring back the Relic, but after their return, no method could be found to extract the magic from them. Angered, Huang’s corporate overlords made them a permanent asset as a Source hunter to pay their debt. Able to take on much more cybernetics than other mortals due to the Elixir’s power, Huang was made into a test bed for various prototypes developed by the corp. They would occasionally die in the line of duty, or due to a cyberware malfunction, but the elixir would then make Huang’s body regrow and reform. Over decades, Huang came to despise the Elixir – feeling it has stolen their future – and as an extension, developed a disgusted attitude toward their own flesh. They have come to believe that through cybernetics they are taking back control of their own body, willfully ignoring the fact this tech comes from the same corp that is still using them for its own needs. Over the years, all traces of emotion have been burned out of Huang by the atrocities they were forced to commit. Only one thing remains – hope, that one day they could find a Source that will grant them the release of death. The density of technology in what is now Huang causes so much Noise that it grants them a unique resistance against Mythoi. They are also armed with Source-touched items that the corporation lends, whatever is perfect for the job. On particularly dangerous or high-stakes missions Huang may be accompanied by a Source hunting team, consisting of a HURT Officer and several Investigators (Scale 1). The corporation behind Huang is left deliberately open. It could also be that it was dissolved in the past decades, and that Huang was left being employed by a small group that leases them to different corps, making their origin even less clear, and allowing them to pop up anywhere and without warning. \\n MAMA DIWA',\n",

This places them in direct opposition to most of the other Gordian members, as well as mainstream Noise spreaders such as Epis. Mama Diwa strongly believes all other forms of Esoteric teachings are dangerous, and has killed before and will kill again to stop those she considers as enemies of humanity. In order to affect someone not present, Mama Diwa requires a sympathetic connection to the target, such as a drawing of their likeness, something belonging to them or a piece of hair or nail clipping. She uses this connection to create a poppet, a little doll magically connected to the target, and then uses it to affect the target from a distance. Anything her insects do to the poppet will affect the target as if they were present. She keeps poppets of her enemies, but also of some of her close allies, since the same magic can be used to heal and help them. Mama Diwa usually asks for a strand of hair or a drop of blood as collateral for a future favor, and prepares a poppet from it. If a character agreed to these terms, you can inflict Consequences on them without need for further Threat. \\n\\n Challenge Directory \\n Anyone can approach Mama Diwa and ask for a cure, a charm, or a hex, for themselves or someone else. Her charms, cures and hexes are delivered via insects – roaches, centipedes and beetles. If the person asking is not from her community, she will ask for a future favor – the character takes debt to Mama Diwa. Seeing as the crew are accomplished mercs, the favors she’ll ask of them should mainly revolve around undermining Epis or other Gordian cells, using brute force or tech where her curses can’t reach. \\n | \\n\\n 325 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

The Jolly Rogers are a gang of thrill-seeking motorheads who besiege mega-corp vaults and commit high-speed robberies using ramshackle vehicles customized with military-grade weapons. Like their cars, the Jolly Rog- ers are covered with eye-catching tattoos, scavenged body mods, and are as boisterous as their engines. They speed around the city, conducting deadly drag races where there’s only one rule: there are no rules. Being a superstitious lot, practicing old sailors’ traditions, the gang has been able to imbue their vehicles with the powers of the sea. Zachary “Crossbones” Edwards is the leader of the Jolly Rogers. He can be recognized by his outdated cybernetic eye and leg, his hair-trigger temper, and love for carnage. \\n\\n DEPLETED \\n\\n LIMITS \\n 4 \\n\\n WRECK \\n When Zachary discovers the location of another Source through his drone J.I.M.’s digital map – which is connected to the lost cyberspace Domain of Treasure Island – he brings out the big guns.

Despite The Lady’s high-tech design, its wooden steering wheel is actually the Source of the Queen Anne’s Revenge (Blackbeard’s flagship), and grants The Lady its superior firepower. \\n\\n MY TH O S P OWER S ET \\n the',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND': 'BACKGROUND\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The Threadwelle Organization is an international contrac- tor for provision of government services in the sectors of health, incarceration, and immigration administration and services. In other words, they build and manage peniten- tiaries, hospitals, and government offices, and also supply training programs and personnel, ranging from security officers to bureaucrats of various levels. Secretly, Threadwelle has come completely under the control of the Mythoi of the Moirai, the Greek Fates. Several years ago the executive board managed to gain a powerful Source of the Fates, a set of Esoteric practices that could allow someone to see the future and influence destiny. Their hope was to learn how to manipulate people’s destinies en masse, to merge fate and statistics and keep their facilities at full capacity by turning around the fortunes of the healthy and lawful. Perhaps someone in the corp made a mistake and changed Threadwelle’s destiny, or perhaps knowledge of the future is too much for mortal minds. Whatever happened, Threadwelle has become obsessed with the promise of knowing and controlling fate, with much of upper management converting into a de facto cult of the Moirai. Its field operations are now focused on trying to find fate-bending Sources, each team overseen by three leads: a Clotho, a Lachesis, and an Atropos (taking names from the three Fates themselves). The individuals change, but their roles are “guided” by the implementation of a neurological synaptic enforcer, that pushes the executive’s personality away in favor of the Fate, as befitting their role. As a useful extra, the brain implant provides direct connection with Threadwelle’s fate-calculating main computer, the Oddsmaker, which can predict a foe’s combat maneuvers with excellent accuracy . \\n JAIL TIME \\n\\n About a decade ago, climate catastrophes flooded a coastal sector of the Megacity, including a Threadwelle prison fa- cility, the Skeiron Correctional Complex. Skeiron became partly submerged alongside docks, factories, tenements, and warehouses in the area, forcing Threadwelle to move their prisoners and abandon the facility. The entire port district around the facility was abandoned as well, and is now known as the Sludge Zone. Karl ‘The Gemcutter’ Masaryk was an infamous inmate at Skeiron during the floods. A genius in synthetic gems and a maker of intaglios (engraved semi-precious gemstones), Karl was imprisoned for multiple counts of gemstone fraud against major corporations. His interest in gems went beyond their monetary value, and through his studies of ancient art he also became a dabbler in the occult, with some basic Esoteric understanding of gem lore. Even in prison the Gemcutter’s forgery skills were sought out, netting him gemstones and tools with which he carved the magical Labyrinth Intaglio, his magnum opus, out of a blood red carnelian gemstone. Only his then-cellmate, Basil Sideris, knew about this intaglio. Karl knew the Labyrinth Intaglio had a special power, but didn’t understand how to use it. He hid it in Cell Block Bravo, where a Thin Place began to develop around the gem. Strange happenings began haunting the cell block, and as prisoners were evacuated during the flood, a feeling of dread led to panic and riots. Basil Sideris escaped in the chaos, while the Gemcutter was sent to a new facility, reluctantly leaving the intaglio behind. Several other inmates of the block vanished altogether and were never found. In truth, the Labyrinth Intaglio had grown strong feeding on the violence of the riots, trapping the missing inmates and turning them into minotaurs. \\n TREASURE IN THE DUNGEON \\n\\n Interested in creating more Threads, and wishing to understand how to create other, more controllable Labyrinths in their other prisons, Threadwelle personnel interviewed past inmates of Skeiron and came upon the Gemcutter. He guessed at the origins of the Thin Place, and convinced Threadwelle they needed his help to find and replicate the Labyrinth Intaglio. Thus the Gemcutter was recruited, becoming Lachesis-203 and leading the search at Skeiron. Clotho-203 and Atropos-203 were tasked with testing his loyalty and usefulness. They gave him access to the company’s occult library, broadening his knowledge of fate-bending Esoteric rituals. The Labyrinth has proven difficult to navigate, even with the use of an Ariadne Thread, and the intaglio is yet to be found. Meanwhile, Threadwelle continues to take prisoners to Skeiron, releasing them into its depths in a cruel attempt to manufacture more Ariadne Threads. \\n JOB SYNOPSIS \\n\\n The crew comes into the picture thanks to Kallikantzaros & Partners, a law firm which had been working to free the Gemcutter by overturning his convictions, in the hopes of leveraging his genius in synthetic gem-making. After he was recruited by Threadwelle, K&P noticed his disappear- ance and connected it to rumors of renewed activity at the Skeiron Correctional Complex. Concerned, it sent fixer Francine ‘Frank’ Solid to hire a crew to investigate what’s happening at the prison, and to rescue the Gemcutter if he was still alive. Kallikantzaros & Partners have identified the Gemcut- ter’s old cellmate, Basil Raptis, who is now living under the alias Saint Bede, and they believe his experience can help the crew infiltrate Skeiron. However, the Gemcutter/ Lachesis-203 knows his former cellmate is a loose end, and has sent assassin drones to remove him. After possibly gathering some helpful tips, the crew heads to Skeiron through the Sludge Zone, running into Source fanatics and mutated jellyfish, eventually reaching the prison complex. Approaching the Threadwelle operation in whichever way they choose, they face off against At- ropos-203 and Clotho-203 and eventually get into the Labyrinth itself, where they discover the man they’re after is not a prisoner in need of rescue, but Lachesis-203. \\n\\n S t r i n g s At ta c h e d \\n Recently, Threadwelle identified strange readings in their Skeiron online Domain, which was still running and was now starting to become warped by the existence of the Labyrinth. An initial investigation ended with the whole team slaughtered at the hands of the minotaurs of Cell Block Bravo, but a second (more careful) team discovered something of great interest: As the first team attempted to escape the Labyrinth, the Thin Place manifested their desperation in the form of a delicate, golden thread. Thread- welle discovered that this Ariadne Thread could be used as a guide to secret entrances and exits and help avoid alarms and traps, in both the physical and virtual worlds. \\n | \\n\\n 335 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist.

       " 'MEETING THE CREW': 'MEETING THE CREW\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Act 0 serves as an introduction to the job. It has a single scene: the dizzying heights of a crane in the dilapidated docks of the Sludge Zone, where the crew’s fixer chooses to meet. \\n\\n INTRO & CHARACTERS \\n\\n Start by reading Rapid Download #1: Welcome to :Other- scape, Punks (page 68). Then, continue on to Rapid Download #2: Characters & Crew (page 70) to establish your player characters and crew. \\n THE HOOKS \\n\\n Before starting the opening scene where the crew will meet fixer Frank Solid at the crane, take a minute to consider how your crew gets involved in this job and what their professional and personal stakes are in completing it. Why are they taking on this job? Solid, who is running the job for her client, K&P, can offer spe- cific motivations fitting the crew, based on their crew theme. • Someone the crew cares about could have been recently transferred into the secretly re-opened Skeiron Correction- al Complex, perhaps a fellow gang member or a loved one, which is well-suited for a crew of Community Protectors or a Rebellious Street Gang. For a crew of Wanted or a Source Cabal this person is instead someone who knows a secret they care about. The crew were looking for a way to get into the prison, and made contact with Frank after they heard she is in the market for someone like them. • A crew who have their finger on the pulse of the Source market, such as All-Around Fixers, a Source Cabal, or Source-Hunting Privateers, could have heard rumors about \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n • A paycheck is a great reason to take any job, but getting into Frank’s contact list could be an even better one for a crew that is looking to make a name for themselves. This could be especially enticing to a crew of All-Around Fixers, Elite Specialists, or a Found Family. Frank is known for being discreet and connected to many of the big players, from which she knows how to squeeze the best reward there is: Favors. She can make Kallikantzaros & Partners provide both legal and illegal perks. \\n\\n 336 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n a new Thin Place inside Skeiron – completely untapped new ground to explore. Getting paid for the Gemcutter’s rescue is simply a bonus; getting a chance to examine and perhaps acquire new Sources is the real incentive. • The crew might be pushed into doing this job due to leverage, with Kallikantzaros & Partners agreeing not to do something if the crew get Karl for them. A crew of Commu- nity Protectors might want K&P to cease from advancing an agenda on their home turf, and Elite Specialists who work for a patron might be sent by their employers to serve K&P as part of a negotiation between higher-ups. \\n OPENING SCENE: THE CRANE \\n\\n Read aloud the following: \\n\\n The wind howls under a bleak sky as you al- most slip and fall. The climb to the top of the old shipyard crane is difficult and not for the faint of heart. This fixer, Solid, who’s supposed to have a job for you, chose the strangest place to meet. At one point, this whole area was part of the infrastructure for the docks, but that was long ago. Now these ten or twenty square miles are silted up and unused. Ever since the floods, it’s just “the Sludge Zone”. The giant crane perches above it all with an eagle’s eye view of the surrounding chemical marsh and the dark waters of the narrow bay beyond. A bro- ken bridge juts out into the waves, toward a derelict island. This is the midden pile left behind by the Megacity and few would come here except on serious business. \\n Ask each player to briefly describe their character and her ap- pearance. Encourage the players to interact as their characters, describing what they say or do as they all climb the crane. Read outloud Rapid Download #3: Playing A Scene (page 76). When the timing seems right, the climb is over and the PCs meet their contact, Solid. Establish the scene by reading the following: \\n\\n Francine “Frank” Solid, professional fix- er, stands at the top of the crane like a storm goddess watching the ground below, her broad shoulders hugged by a tactical vest as her short curly hair writhes in the wind. She stands impassively as you climb, watch- ing and assessing the visitors to her steel Olympus. As you reach the top, where a wind- break creates a small haven from the rush- ing winds, a fist-sized drone detaches itself from her cybernetic shoulder socket, floating to examine each of your faces. Solid nods in approval as your identities are confirmed. “Good, you made it.” Her voice is hoarse, and you can see a bluish vapor wafting on her breath. “Nice climb? I don’t hire cow- ards for my contracts, so, glad we got that out of the way.” Solid gives you a moment to settle your- selves on the metal framework of the crane. “I’ve got a contract with Kallikantzaros & Partners to find an associate of theirs, Karl Masaryk. He’s a con who was evacuated along with several hundred others out of that hell hole, when the water came.” With a face like a stormcloud, Solid points toward the bay, at a derelict island out in the waves. “Skeiron Correctional Complex.” “But now the company that owns it, Thread- welle, has moved back in and they seem to have brought Masaryk with them, alongside some other inmates. Officially, the place is still closed, so whatever they’re doing is probably being backed up by armed corporate guards. This also creates an opportunity to break Masaryk out, which is what K&P are willing to pay for. Apparently he’s a genius when it comes to synthetic gems. They call him ‘The Gemcutter’. Or at least they would, if you manage to get him out of there in one piece. Otherwise, you’ll know him as ‘a corpse that cost us a lot of money’.” \\n Then, ask the table “What do you do?” and give one of the players the spotlight. Think of this opening scene as a training room for the Establish > Action > Consequence loop. Start off with the players merely narrating their actions. For now, there is no need to make any rolls or deliver Consequences. Even if someone does something on the crane that could go wrong you can narrate it as risky, but eventually harmless. As long as their actions are reasonable, just assume they succeed and narrate accordingly. • Threadwelle is a worldwide contractor for the provision of government services in the sectors of health, incarcer- ation, and immigration administration. The government pays them, and they do everything: train administrative staff, provide security, and build facilities. Their correc- tional complexes are in high demand for their secure facilities and high rehabilitation rate. • About a decade ago, climate disasters and pollution created the Sludge Zone, forcing Threadwell to abandon Skeiron. They scattered its prisoners to other Threadwelle facilities in the Megacity. It’s unclear why they’re back now, the place is still flooded, after all. • Karl Masaryk is an expert in creating artificial precious stones, who has worked for various cartels in the past. While he was in Skeiron, he continued his work using materials smuggled in to produce synthetic gems in a makeshift lab. The gems can be worth something in counterfeit jewelry, but they are most useful in tech- nological applications. Masaryk was never much of an engineer, however. • The Gemcutter had nearly finished his sentence at another facility before he disappeared. Kallikantzaros & Partners probably paid off officials to get Masaryk out early, and were pissed off when Threadwelle pulled off some bullshit bureaucracy trick to transfer him back to Skeiron. K&P then managed to identify the Gemcutter’s former cellmate, Basil Sideris, who escaped Skeiron and is living under a false identity, Saint Bede. That would be a good lead to start with. Solid also encourages the crew to run some searches and hit some contacts to dig up more information about Skeiron, and points them at The Dead Dock as the nearest illegal market and launchpad for their Skeiron job. \\n MOVING ON \\n\\n When the players are ready to move to the next scene, discuss what they plan on doing. The players can speak as their characters, enacting the discussion as they make their way down from the crane. Congratulations, you’ve just MC’d your first :Otherscape scene! Move on to Act I. The natural place for the next scene is The Dead Dock, where the crew touch down from the crane and begin gathering more information about their target before heading to Skeiron. \\n\\n S t r i n g s At ta c h e d \\n Once you feel comfortable with the rhythm of the conver- sation, if someone takes an action that you deem dramatic, such as trying to discern if Frank Solid is hiding anything, you can jump ahead to Rapid Download #4: Taking Action (page 84) to make a roll; if the roll generates Consequenc- es keep them narrative, e.g., Solid looks like they make a nasty mental note about that PC in their head. Otherwise, continue reading. \\n KEEP TALKING, FRANK \\n\\n If the crew asks about Threadwelle or Karl Masaryk, Solid only has general information. She will tell them the following: \\n | \\n\\n 337 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n ACT I:',\n",
       " 'COMMON THREADS -  - JOB BRIEFING': 'COMMON THREADS\\n\\n\\nJOB BRIEFING\\n\\n\\n In this Act, the crew gather some useful information about Skeiron and the Gemcutter and learn the lengths that Threadwelle is willing to go to stop their interference. You will learn how to take actions as players and deliver Consequences as the MC. \\n\\n Start the Act at The Dead Dock, as the PCs descend from the meeting with Frank Solid to walk among the polluted slum and start looking for actionable information about their target. From there, you can continue to any of the other three scenes. \\n THE DEAD DOCK \\n\\n While it’s probably technically still owned by some company, the ruined shipyard pier known as the Dead Dock hasn’t been visited by anyone in authority for more than a decade. It has become a community of the reject- ed, one of many, many places in the Megacity where the have-nots gather, steal some pow- er and net access, and set up a trading post and some hovels. Several ancient vessels are still moored to the docks; they won’t sail ever again, but the lights and fresh graffiti show they see active use as shelter. \\n The Dead Dock is a natural starting place for any job in the Sludge Zone. Useful information can be heard or bought here, and specialized or black market gear is on offer by various vendors, including weapons. Establish the scene by reading the opening text and setting the stakes: the PCs just got a job to bust the Gemcutter, Karl Masaryk, out of a submerged prison in the Sludge Zone, Skeiron. But what do they really know about any of it? They know Threadwelle is acting suspicious, but don’t know why, and they have a lead, Basil Sideris/Saint Bede, but no address. Suggest to them that while they are here they can make initial inquiries, whether locally or online. \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Under the immense tin roof that shields (most) of this cavernous hall from the acid rainfall, those who have been pushed out of “normal” life have created a life of their own. They welcome people like you here. They might have something to sell, or something to say, seeing as they’re sitting on the edges of the Sludge Zone. 338 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n Then, ask the players “What do you do?”, and give the spot- light to one of the PCs. Have that PC take action, resolve it with a roll if appropriate, and deliver Consequences. Re-establish the scene, and repeat the same with the next PC, and the next, until the scene is exhausted or the PCs have enough intel to point them to one of the next scenes. \\n GATHERING INFORMATION: QUICK OUTCOME \\n\\n While at the Dead Dock, the crew can learn more about the Gemcutter and Skeiron by: • Running online searches and calling contacts • Trading information with the local merchants and criminal elements • Surveilling Skeiron from afar Read Rapid Download #4: Taking Action (page 84). The first time a player gets a miss (-6) or mixed hit (7-9), read Rapid Download #6: Consequences (page 98) and deliver a Consequence. Based on your choice of Con- sequence, it will point you to learn about Statuses (page 103) and/or Story Tags (page 110). On a hit (strong or mixed), the PC’s action reveals some of the information below. • Basil Sideris: Basil has undergone plastic surgery and fingerprint removal, but his attempt to erase his pre- vious identity only partially succeeded and some hints remain. Today he goes by the name Saint Bede, owner of the Bede’s Venerable Boxing Club in another part of the Megacity. With a great success, the PC learns Bede responds well to financial incentives (bribes). • Skeiron: One of the VR Domains servers previously used in Skeiron was repurposed as a virtual environment known as The Vineyard, a pleasure Domain leased to a Threadwelle subsidiary. Some old details about the prison might still remain beneath The Vineyard’s framework, but the Domain attracts some rich, nostalgic visitors, so security is tight. With a great success, the PC learns that the system’s security alertness manifests as raven digital constructs. • Sludge Zone dangers: While the Sludge Zone is gener- ally deserted since environmental degradation made it impossible to use as a waterfront, a gang called the Crocodilians has laid claim to much of the area. With a great success, the PC also learns about the massive underwater creatures called prismatic jellies, which reside close to the Skeiron facility. • The prisoners being brought in: People in the Dead Dock are generally aware there’s new activity in the Skeiron Correctional Complex, since a black VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft arrived there two or three times in the past few days. Digging through government records and Threadwelle’s internal transportation logs (accessi- ble to any hacker worth their salt without much trouble) show about a dozen prisoners “disappearing” from other facilities in the past few days, but their names have been scrubbed off the system and all further information is locked under the authority of a “Clotho-203”. For Consequences, on a mixed hit, the PC could get a strange look or a reluctant answer; on a miss, the contact the PC tapped doesn’t want to continue the discussion; they’re afraid of whoever is trying to keep this quiet (Deny Them Something They Want). \\n SHOPPING AROUND: TRACKED OUTCOME \\n\\n If one of the PCs attempts to purchase something from the Dead Dock locals, you can learn about actions that combine a roll with choosing Effects, known as a tracked outcome. Read Rapid Download #5: Effects (page 90). Based on the player’s choice of Effects, it will point you to learn about Statuses (page 103) and/or Story Tags (page 110). On a hit, they may spend their Power on Create to gain a story tag at the cost of 2 Power per tag. Many Street Catalog items are available here (page 252), especially if they can be useful in the marshes and/or illegal. Some of the spe- cialized items and services sold at the Dead Dock include a protective rubber suit, makeshift trident, pills for sludge sickness, dingy, local guide, acid-resistant sealant, or an automatic flechette speargun. If they can’t quite make 2 Power to purchase a story tag, they can Enhance themselves with a positive status such as solvent-1 or use Influence to make the seller friendly-1, which could affect future rolls. Read Rapid Download #8: Story Tags & Tag Effects (page 110). As a Consequence, inflict a status on the PC, such as, short- on-cash-2 or ignored-1, or make the seller annoyed-1. At your option, the player may try to mitigate it (Rapid Download #6: Consequences, page 98). \\n\\n Consequences are how you turn tension into action. When you get a chance to inflict a Consequence, you make things difficult for the crew – it’s up to you to decide how, choosing according to your cinematic considerations of what’s most dramatically satisfying. Here are some ideas for Consequences relevant to this Act. Escalate the Situation: Introduce the Assassin Drones, Incoming scene. Present a New Challenge: A Scavenger (page 314) begins to tail the crew. Deny Them Something They Want: The alarm trig- gers in the Vineyard and everyone is ejected; Bede escapes into the alleyways. Make the Future Bleaker: A bystander is killed by a stray shot during a fight with the assassin drones; part of the infrastructure in the Dead Dock collapses on someone’s hovel. Consequences With Effects: • Poking around in cyberspace left some frustrating adware in the PC’s HUD (distracting pop-ups or annoying-buzz-2) • Locals don’t appreciate the PCs asking questions and are making their displeasure clear (cowed-1 or the locals gain distant-2) • A PC gets a message about something important that distracts them, so they’re struggling to keep their mind on the mission (distracted-1 or burn a Self tag) • Strong emotions disrupt focus, or ingredients get spoiled, making a Source power less effective (drained-1 or burn a Myhos tag) • Radio feedback is disrupting the interface of a drone, or the acidic atmosphere gets into the gear (jammed-1 or burn a Noise tag) • In the heat of action a piece of equipment is re- vealed to be faulty, or gets hit and shorts outs (burn a Loadout tag) \\n\\n S t r i n g s At ta c h e d \\n WRAPPING UP \\n\\n By the end of this scene, the PCs should have at least one lead pointing them to Bede’s Venerable Boxing Club or The Vineyard. Alternatively, if they delay too much, you can trigger the Assassin Drones, Incoming scene. \\n FOR',\n",

You as the MC make Threats during the Establish phase by describing something neg- ative or dangerous that the Challenge at hand is about to do. If the PC’s action doesn’t address that Threat, you can deliver the Challenge’s Consequences, regardless of the outcome of the player’s roll.

It can move across walls and ceilings with gecko-adhesive limb ends, quickly and quietly, maneuvering into an attack position above its target. When ready to attack, the drone anchors its “wrist” and fires dart-tipped wires from each of its digits. The operator can send electrical charges along the wires or metal frame itself to electrocute someone on contact. A single operator often controls a pair of such drones, but a skilled drone-user can sometimes manage more. The drones have no AI capabilities, and cease working if disconnected from their controlling signal. These assassin drones have been scrubbed of anything that would identify who sent them. However, a PC who cares to analyze the signal data can figure out that the transmissions controlling the drones originated from the direction of Skeiron. There are as many Puppeteer-Hands as there are PCs. Unless the crew somehow saw them coming, the drones begin the fight with ambushing-2. \\n\\n LIMITS \\n When you first start a tracked conflict with a Challenge, read Rapid Download #5: Effects (page 90) and Rapid Download #7: Statuses (page 103). \\n ASSASSIN DRONES, INCOMING \\n\\n While the PCs are getting the information they need, Threadwelle doesn’t just stand by and wait for them.

Wide holographic displays along the walls show old boxing matches and visually appealing ads for sporting equipment and genetic augmentations. Club members are scattered around the front room hitting punching bags or sparring with each other or practice androids. Some of them are obviously jacked on Nitro or some other enhancer, most of them seem like they spend every waking hour in the club. As you take in the room, a door in the back opens long enough to release the roar of a small crowd. The stairs down must lead to the basement and the boxing ring. \\n Bede’s Venerable Boxing Club is partly a training gym and partly a betting venue for bare-knuckle boxing matches. It is a grimy and adrenaline-charged destination for boxing hopefuls during the day and gamblers during the night, all coming from the surrounding district. If the crew visits the club during daylight hours or early evening, the match downstairs is a friendly one. Closer to midnight the serious matches start up and the betting windows open up. If a PC examines the place or tries to get the mood in the air, resolve this as a quick outcome and reveal the following. Choose how much to reveal based on how well the action succeeded. • The place doesn’t brandish any corp logos, which is strange, because most privately-owned places get some sponsorship or are pressured into taking one. • This could mean the owner is working with an organized crime syndicate or is so paranoid that they’re not working with anyone. Fending for yourself in the Megacity is nigh im- possible, so the owner must have some trick up their sleeve. • Their trick: the owner supplies the boxers with a Nitro-Sun- spot cocktail (Enhancers, page 263), thus buying the loyalty of a small army of easily hyped-up muscle brutes. As a fugitive, Saint Bede will be initially unwilling to admit he is Basil Sideris, but he can be convinced to help with financial incentive or threats (maxing out his bribe or threaten Limits). He might even accept a bet in the ring: if his opponent can land some punches on him (max out his hurt-or-subdue Limit), he will talk. As a serious Consequence, especially if the crew is mis- behaving, the club members could gather around them in preparation to beat them up. If a fight begins you can treat the club members as Gang Members (page 306), but this is an excellent opportunity to instead have the assassin drones attack (page 340). They release themselves from hiding places along the ceiling, target- ing Saint Bede and electrocuting everyone in their way. Threadwelle sees Saint Bede as a loose end, since he was close to The Gemcutter, and would like to take him down before he talks. If he survives the attack, he will be indebted to the crew and share what he knows. \\n WHAT THE SAINT KNOWS \\n\\n Once they get him to talk, Saint Bede can reveal the fol- lowing information. • He can describe the layout of the prison from memory, but it’s been years and the high water may have caused structural collapses. The crew gain the story tag basic prison layout which could help them navigate the prison later. • Saint Bede and Karl The Gemcutter were in a ground-floor cell, number 12, in Cell Block Bravo. He had the top bunk, The Gemcutter the bottom. Their cell must be underwater now. He shivers when he thinks about Cell Block Bravo; it was a strange, creepy place even before the flood, and Saint Bede believes the place must now be haunted by those who died there. • He and Karl had become close friends. During the flood riots when Skeiron was being abandoned, he and Karl almost escaped, but his friend was caught. If the crew reveal The Gemcutter is in Skeiron again, Bede suspects Karl would try to retrieve a special engraved gem, an inta- glio he created in jail and held some special value to him. \\n\\n S t r i n g s At ta c h e d \\n MEETING WITH THE SAINT \\n\\n The owner of the club is Basil Sideris, who now goes by the name Saint Bede. He feels comfortable in his club, sur- rounded by people loyal to him. He is likely to be where the action is, watching the matches in the basement, and when it’s a friendly event he might even enter the ring himself. Saint Bede is quick to keep up on what’s happening in his club, so as soon as the crew enters upstairs his employees let him know that some unfamiliar faces have arrived. He won’t approach unless they ask for him or start some trouble. \\n | \\n\\n 341 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284',\n",

A skilled hacker can Harness the crew in, encoding their real-world skills and abilities into their digital avatars. \\n\\n As your avatars resolve in the virtual space of the Vineyard, the soft sound of birds and humming insects begins to play. Rows of grape vines stretch out towards the horizon, past a beautiful manor house with a patio cafe. The sun is bright and the scenery is perpetually green, a fake idyllic scene for relaxation and socializing, with just the right amount of gamified elements encouraging visitors to buy a premium pass. There are no smells at all, though; a pop-up explains with apologet- ic language that no scents will be available until a small grid failure is fixed. It’s a beautiful scene nonetheless, so much so that you can almost forget that the virtu- al space is built on the scrubbed remains of a prison’s administrative Domain. Somewhere in the soil under the grapevines could be useful data fragments from Skeiron. \\n The Vineyard is a virtual environment designed to resemble a vineyard in the (nowadays gravely different) French wine country. When Skeiron was abandoned, some of its servers were removed and scrubbed, and Threadwelle repurposed them for use by one of its subsidies that caters to executives from the firms and governments Threadwelle works with. As a VR Domain designed as a private escape for an exclusive few, the security protocols are considerable. However, there’s no reason for the PCs to try and enter the chateau itself – the core of the Domain – since it’s possible that some shadow data from Skeiron remains buried in the digital framework. This is represented in the metaphor as the ground. The Vinyard’s security system is represented by the Limit alarm. Use The Vineyard’s Threats and Consequences to build up alarm-1 statuses until the system shuts down; \\n\\n This VR environment simulates an elegant French chateau on a hill overlooking perfect, green vineyards.

Warm winds carry an acidic smell, and the creaking sound of shifting metal. \\n To get to the Skeiron Correctional Complex in the heart of the Sludge Zone, the crew must overcome the Sludge Zone Run Challenge, representing the dangers they might face on the way. They do so by taking actions to Advance the traverse Limit (Playing Through A Tracked Conflict, page 340). \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n The Sludge Zone itself is what remains of the lowest-lying parts of a wide waterfront, aban- doned a decade ago due to rising waters from climate catastrophe. Flooding brought other problems, such as contamination, rust, and erosion. Despite some attempts to clean up and rebuild over the years, the projects all met with failure. Nowadays it is a dangerous derelict area, plagued by brutal street gang members, monstrous wildlife, and hidden Con- jurations. It’s become known as a quick and effective site in which to dump dead bodies, as the sludge or the monsters that dwell here are sure to eat away the remains. And it’s not like the law ever shows its face. 344 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield.

An ever-present threat in the Sludge Zone, this gang of fanatics worships a Source of Sobek, the crocodile-headed Egyptian god of pharaonic power and military strength. They control half of the Sludge Zone and defend their territory with a ferocity born of zeal and deprivation – the Crocodilians eat the bodies of their enemies. Their Source, a bronze crocodile statue that grows real crocodile hide, is hidden in an underwater lair. From it they remove patches of hide which they then graft onto them- selves, allowing the scales to grow across their bodies. The Source gives them resilience and the ability to hold their breath as long as a crocodile can, and with a fervent prayer they are able to summon Conjured crocodiles to their side. They are armed with water-adapted submachine guns, and patrol their territory on camouflaged airboats (swamp boats). When the Crocodilians appear, read the following: \\n\\n You hear the whirr of propellers, and with- in moments you are surrounded by airboats appearing out from the smog. Men and women dressed in crude wetsuits, bearing patch- es of real crocodile skin on their faces, necks, or arms, are hanging on the airboats with the confidence of those who know the Zone well, and consider themselves to be the biggest threat around.

The stakes are about to get higher, so the players will need more tools at their disposal in order to survive the day. It’s time to learn about burning tags for Power and Going Out In A Blaze. Read Rapid Download #11: Power Options (page 121). \\n THE SUBMERGED COMPLEX \\n\\n As the PCs arrive at Skeiron, they find the complex mostly ruined beyond repair, with water flooding its lower levels and courtyard. However, from up close, it’s clear two main areas protrude over the waterline: the Skeiron Guard Tower, and the roof of Cell Block Alpha, which is covered with an inflatable dome, camouflaged the same color as the gray concrete structure. Low lights emanate from both and there’s some local digital activity in Nearspace (Skeiron Domain). The submerged complex, its surrounding waters, and the jutting ruins are being watched by the guard tower as well as by Atropos-203, Threadwelle’s assassin and trapmaster who is one of the three main leaders of the Threadwelle operation at Skeiron. He is constantly patrolling and skulking about, grace- fully navigating the exposed rocks and broken walls around. \\n HIGH ALERT \\n\\n Use an alarm:3 Limit to track the alert level of the Skei- ron security force but do not reveal its maximum to the players. When a guard notices something unusual as a Consequence, the security team gains alarm-1. A guard that sees the crew can reach for their radio (Threat) and trigger the alarm at once (alarm-3). The alarm level can be lowered by hacking the Skeiron Domain or somehow influencing the guards to drop their guard (Set Back). \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Getting to the Cell Block Alpha dome without alerting the nearby security forces requires some sort of subterfuge or distraction – a quick roll for each PC trying to sneak past.

Each location below lists the measures they can take to prepare for the crew’s infiltration or assault attempt if they are expecting it. \\n TAGGED BY THREADWELLE \\n\\n Threadwelle has anticipated other factions becoming interested in Skeiron, but due to their desire to keep their activities in the Sludge Zone secret, they have opted to deploy only quiet defensive measures. Electronic sensor nets, placed at strategic points to watch for trouble, might have digitally tagged the crew with tagged-1 (in the Sludge Zone Run). Threadwelle Operatives who watch the open waters from the guard tower are quick to do so as well if they get a glimpse of the characters. Being digitally tagged makes it harder for the PC to sneak and avoid attention while in Skeiron, at least while the virtual Domain is active, as its security nets are trained to pick up tagged appearance, movement patterns, IR print, sounds, etc. In addition, Threadwelle’s Oddsmaker forecast- ing system can also turn this status into predictable, which makes it very easy for the Operatives to foil any PC action, to say nothing about shooting at them! This status lasts just for a few moments – the Oddsmaker’s predictive power only stretches a few seconds into the future. However, the data gathered is not lost, and the predictable status reverts back to tagged, which can be reused by the Oddsmaker. \\n SKEIRON GUARD TOWER \\n\\n The Skeiron Correctional Complex has held together, but there’s only one part of it that still stands tall. Facing the Sludge Zone is a guard tower, jutting up into the air like a foreboding sentry, gray and bulky. Around the top is a ringed walkway that looks over the rest of Skeiron, low lights emanating from its dark windows. \\n The tower is manned by three Threadwelle Operatives (Scale 1) who benefit from elevated position. It’s three stories tall and slippery due to the sea mist. Consequence during a climb, which would require a quick action, can lead to the Operatives becoming suspicious (alarm-1), a dangerous fall onto the rocks below (broken-bones-3), or the loss of an important piece of equipment (burning a gear tag). If the alarm is raised, two of the Operatives climb down through the stairs inside the tower to a hallway that leads directly to Cell Block Alpha. The third one remains here in a sniping position.',\n",

Ever since the implant, he has become obsessed with brandishing ancient scissors as weapons and the motif of snipping a person’s life thread. Atropos-203 works best where there’s space for him to set traps and surprise his enemies with scissors conjured out of thin air. Threadwelle operatives are well-rounded personnel, capable in both close quarters and ranged combat. Originating as a pilot program to train elite prison guards, the Operatives came to serve Theradwelle as a paramilitary force and they are equipped accordingly. They answer only to the three team leads: Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. If captured, they refuse to engage with any form of questioning, instead demanding to be ransomed back to Theradwelle. Version 203 is a wiry Thai man of medium height, cropped black hair, and sharp features. Like other Atropos team leads, he dons a dark hood that hides a hollow stare, but he is otherwise dressed tactically for marine military operation at the complex. Atropos-203 is directly connected to the Oddsmaker server itself, many miles away, with a taut ethereal thread tied to his wrist that seems to disappear into nothingness.

From inside the crumbling structure an inflated dome rises, pushing against the holes in the ceilings and miss- ing walls, camouflaged with the same color as the gray, molding structure surrounding it. Inside, a dozen or so Threadwelle analysts and operatives have settled in a makeshift camp, which gives the vibes of a forward exploration outpost. In one corner, a group of operatives is going through a briefing, as if getting ready to head into hostile terri- tory; close by, two analysts are trying to make sense of a holographic display showing a baffling, labyrinthian map. In the middle, a tower supporting the dome’s center holds an assortment of maintenance devices. A large, reinforced steel double door on the opposite side of the dome is kept under guard by two operatives and a sensory secu- rity grid – positioned in such a way as to stop whatever is behind the door. \\n The upper level of this cell block has been converted from a series of cells into a Threadwelle staging area. A sleeping area overlaps with a field kitchen at one side of the dome, and large mobile construction at the center of the area holds a generator, an air purifier, a water tank, and similar maintenance devices. The entrance to Cell Block Bravo is behind the doors (and a sensor grid that imposes tagged-2 if crossed), leading to Threadwelle Command Post. A less suicidal approach, such as utilizing stealth or a distraction, could prove much easier. Everyone here is inattentive-1, due to not expecting danger and trusting the guard tower to raise the alarm. Crossing the staging area requires a roll for each PC. \\n WHAT THREADWELLE PERSONNEL KNOW \\n\\n While the Operatives refuse to answer any question even under duress, the analysts are far more open if questioned. A quick outcome or Discover can reveal the following. \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n There are half a dozen Threadwelle Operatives here, with another ten or so non-combatant analysts. If attacked directly, or if the alarm was raised, the Operatives have home field advantage thanks to knowing the environment inside and outside the dome, and the analysts can deploy and control several Puppeteer-Hand drones (page 340).

There’s something wrong inside Cell Block Bravo, and while no analyst can tell what it is or why it is so, they know Lachesis is inside in searching for something. • Prisoners are being brought into Bravo because according to the current speculation, “their fear can create the thread”. • There are monsters inside that the Operatives have to shoot back every few hours when they approach the entrance. Everyone is worried they’ll break out eventually. • No one here knows the names of any of the prisoners who were brought for the experiments, or the name Karl Masaryk or \"The Gemcutter\". The names are likely to be in the files, though, accessed through the Skeiron Domain. \\n SKEIRON DOMAIN \\n\\n There’s an active Domain in the area, maintained by Thread- welle’s forces, but hacking it directly from Nearspace is practically impossible due to the probability-enforced en- cryption of Threadwelle’s central processor, the Oddsmaker. A pair of oddsmaker goggles can grant a hacker the access they need, with a quick outcome success. There isn’t even any firewall around, as the system admin, Clotho-203, trusts in the anti-intrusion programs to hunt down anyone who dares enter. \\n\\n Gray, barely-lit corridors stretch out in every direction, seemingly leading to emp- ty rooms. It’s clear that this was once a soulless, corporate virtual space, imitating the prison complex in its bland grayness. Threadwelle’s task force has taken over this infrastructure, and integrated it into their monitoring system in the Cell Block Alpha. The feed from Puppeteer-Hand drones stationed in other places in Skeiron can be seen as thin strings trailing through the air. Shimmering nets - or perhaps, spider webs - hang over most corridor entrances. Something is off in the simulated physics, though. Corridors loop in on themselves and doors open onto spaces they physically couldn’t, creating an unsettling disorient- ing sensation. Worse, it all seems to be subtly… shifting over time as if the space is growing and changing whenever you’re not looking.and doors open onto spaces they physically couldn’t, creating an unset- tling disorienting sensation. Worse, it all seems to be subtly… shifting over time as if the space is growing and changing whenever you’re not looking. \\n • Karl Masaryk’s name appears in older records, but it then disappears without any further trace. On the same date, however, Lachesis-203 was initiated into the organization. What’s left of the old prison computer network was reini- tiated by the renewed Threadwelle operation on Skeiron, and is now being used as a local Nearspace Domain that connects all the sensor nets and serves data to the Oper- atives’ Oddsmaker goggles. However, being in proximity to the Labyrinth Thin Place has turned the Domain into a virtual maze. Due to the strange Mythic interference in the Domain, Clotho remains in the system’s core, which is completely closed off and available only through physical hardware access in the Command Post. The rest of the system maintains itself, running all basic necessary applications such as communications and alarms. Once within the Domain, the PCs could attempt a variety of hacking actions, such as: • Search it for old records, in the form of floating boxes • Take control over a security measures (such as a sensor net) and then shut it down or feed it false information • Take control over a set of Oddsmaker goggles and shut them down or feed them false information • Inhibit new information from the sensor nets from being sent to the Oddsmaker (mitigating tagged); once some- one’s pattern data has been sent over, it’s impossible to remove (Restore) without direct access to the Oddsmaker. With walls constantly shifting and disorienting physics, it isn’t easy to navigate through the Domain, whether to try and shut down the alarm, turn off security, or to access files. A good Consequence during navigation can be disoriented-1, or running into a web barrier, after which the Cyberspace Spyders (Domain Security, below) are introduced. \\n WHAT’S IN THE OLD RECORDS \\n\\n Finding the floating boxes representing records requires a roll to navigate the maze. Once found, a hacker can find within all of the information given under What Threadwelle Personnel Knows (page 348), as well as the following details. \\n DOMAIN SECURITY \\n\\n The Domain server is physically located in the Thread- welle Command Post and is Mythically connected to the Oddsmaker via the system admin and one of the mission leaders, Clotho-203. Three Cyberspace Spyders lurk behind corners, waiting for intruders to stumble into any of their many web barriers, which are spread throughout the entire maze.',\n",

       " 'CELL BLOCK BRAVO': 'CELL BLOCK BRAVO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Due to the influence of the Labyrinth Thin Place, it is impossible to enter Cell Block Bravo in any way except through the main double doors – a labyrinth has only one entrance, after all. \\n\\n The entirety of Bravo has become an ever-shifting Labyrinth, with few islands of stability. One such place is the entrance, a short corridor and guard post leading from the reinforced doors in Cell Block Alpha, and this is where Clotho-203 decided to establish the Threadwelle Command Post, to keep a close eye on The Gemcutter, whom she doesn’t trust. \\n THREADWELLE COMMAND POST \\n\\n In a guard post inside the cell block, where prison sentries used to monitor the passage, Threadwelle has set up an observation point. Computer screens glow along the walls, a few showing the outskirts of Skeiron and the Sludge Zone, but most showing a darkened part of the deeper facility. A few Threadwelle employees watch these feeds and keep records while two armed guards stand by in case they are needed.

There’s currently no one inside (they were recently taken into the Labyrinth by The Gemcutter). To enter The Labyrinth, the crew must pass through here. By default, the two Threadwelle Operatives (page 347) are inattentive-1, due to not expecting danger to come from the direction of Cell Block Alpha. The techs in the room are not combat-trained and will mostly keep out of any fight, though they are loyal and brave, and could try to grapple-1 or block-1 intruders. If the alarm was raised, the Operatives are instead alert-3, and the techs are all equipped with guns and ready to shoot on an Operative’s order!

But as soon as you step inside, the walls spin and the floor moves. The way ahead is not as it was, and the way behind – dis- appeared! Twisting corridors branch off from where you stand, some submerged and some not. Rusty iron bars rise and fall in door- ways and passageways like chomping teeth. There’s a clear, unmistakable sensation in the air – you are lost. \\n The Labyrinth Intaglio has turned Cell Block Bravo into a vast maze infested with minotaurs who were once inmates. Transmogrified by the Intaglio, they hunt any prisoners thrown into the maze as tributes. Karl Masaryk, a.k.a. \"The Gemcutter\", a.k.a. Lachesis-203 is here, trying to find the Labyrinth Intaglio with the help of an Ariadne Thread. Pro- tecting him are a handful of Puppeteer-Hand drones (page 340, Scale 1) under his control, and he has also brought in four prisoners. They are meant to be released into “the wilds” in order for their terror and sense of hopelessness to manifest new Ariadne Threads, but the Gemcutter can’t bring himself to do so, justifying his decision to the parts of his personality turned Lachesis by saying the prisoners are needed to protect him from the minotaurs. Introduce the Into the Labyrinth Challenge. At a moment of your choice (after they run around for a while and get into trouble) they encounter a Puppeteer-Hand drone, being controlled by Lachesis. It doesn’t attack, instead sending a voice message to the crew, initiating a conversation through the drone. Lachesis sees the crew as an opportunity to escape Thread- welle and perhaps remove the neural implant. He will not simply join them, however, as he still needs to “find something important”, which he will avoid discussing further out of fear the crew might want the Labyrinth Intaglio to themselves. If the crew mentions Kallikantzaros & Partners, Lachesis turns fearful. K&P tried to recruit him before, putting pressure on him by leaking his illegal activities to the authorities – so that he would need the law firm to bail him out and be in their debt. He still agrees to come with the crew, but will now start to look for options to escape before they hand him over to their employers. \\n | \\n\\n 4 // R U N - M E T R O : O T H E R S C A P E \\n Lachesis immediately realizes the crew is not with Thread- welle, and tries to get them to explain what they’re doing here. If they explain their mission, he is elated; he does not directly say he is Karl Masaryk – the Lachesis personality would rage against it – but it should be clear enough from his behavior if the crew haven’t figured it out by now. \\n\\n 352 \\n\\n Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284 \\n ENTER THE MINOTAUR \\n\\n At one point during the conversation, especially as Conse- quence or if the crew attempt to follow the Lachesis signal to its source, the conversation is cut off with a scream and a roar – a minotaur attacks Lachesis. Lachesis recalls the drone, which the crew can follow back to him, only to find him beset by three minotaurs; the drones Lachesis brought are lying broken on the ground, along with dead and wounded prisoners. If everyone survives the ensuing conflict, a thankful Lachesis is willing to explain what he is looking for and why it’s so important. It is the Source of the deadly Labyrinth and Threadwelle can’t be allowed to get their hands on it. If Lachesis suspects the crew is here to kill him, instead the minotaur attack is a feint, just some audio file. Lachesis and three Puppeteer-Hand drones wait in ambush for the crew as they follow the fourth one back to him. If defeated, he will reveal the existence of the Labyrinth Intaglio in an attempt to bargain for his life. \\n FINDING THE INTAGLIO \\n\\n Any PC with a Mythos theme can realize that finding the intaglio inside the Thin Place has nothing to do with its location, and everything to do with its thematic importance. It lies at the heart of the Labyrinth. This is an opportunity for the players to come up with creative, abstract ideas about what is the heart of the Labyrinth and how to find it. It could be inside the chest of a minotaur, inside Lachesis’s head, or in a room that thumps like a heartbeat which can now be found by fol- lowing the beat. Have them roll to follow through on their idea and find the Labyrinth Intaglio, with any confused, unnerved, or similar statuses acting as hindrances. On a miss, they still find it, but suffer Consequences (perhaps getting minotaur horns!). If the intaglio is destroyed or is taken out of the Labyrinth, the Thin Place begins to crumble and break apart and Cell Block Bravo returns to its mundane, yet still waterlogged, state.',\n",

At first, he enjoyed his freedom and the resources that Threadwelle provides him with, such as cranial drone-control implants, but as the Lachesis persona came to take hold he realized he’s nothing more than a tool for Threadwelle, and broken tools get discarded. Lachesis demands loyalty to Threadwelle, punishing Karl for any thoughts of betrayal, but it’s not yet fully developed and the Gemcutter still keeps much of himself.

It’s now time to zoom out of the action scenes, Load Off (burn all loadout tags), and get ready for some downtime. If you haven’t had a Credit Roll yet (page 125), now is a good time to have one. Here are a few questions to consider and points to revisit when you wrap up this job: • Did the crew retrieve Karl, willing or otherwise? Do they hand him over to Kallikantzaros & Partners? Or do they hear his plea and help him escape all his pursuers? How do they explain this to Solid? • What is to be done about the neurological implants that make Karl loyal to the Threadwelle Organization? K&P might want to hire the crew for a follow-up job, again through Frank Solid, to find the required cryptokeys or an appropriate surgeon, perhaps employed by Threadwelle. It’s an opportunity to get deeper into the corruption and danger of this fate-obsessed corp. • What happened with the Labyrinth? Did it disappear completely, or is some of the Thin Place still there? Do the PCs want to try and gain some control over it, perhaps with the help of the intaglio, if they kept it? Seems like they’ll have to negotiate a more permanent passage with the Crocodilians. • Where does the Labyrinth Intaglio end up? Who uses it, and for what purpose? Can the one-time miracle be repeated, if Karl tries again? Perhaps he needs a proper incentive first or a certain emotional state, or maybe something else was responsible for the intaglio’s power in the first place. • Did someone in the crew max out their upgrade or Decay tracks? Someone might be getting a new Special, or already replace a theme! See Character & Crew Evolu- tions, page 131.',\n",
