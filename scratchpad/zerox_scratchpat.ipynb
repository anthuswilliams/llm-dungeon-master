His biggest client has left the company along with his hopes of moving up on the corporate ladder. The man knows that this is the beginning of the end. Soon everyone at the office will speak of his lack of competence. As the sun sets and the holos of his smart suit light up to cast faint light in the rain, he realizes that he is kneeling before an old roadside shrine; its stone contours shielded from the elements by a sturdy plastic enclosure extending from the nearby bus stop structure. He recognizes the kami depicted on the shrine’s side as a Dōsojin, a spirit of paths and boundaries. He used to pay respect to these shrines, before his job took over his life. And suddenly the businessman feels a warm light emanating from the stone, and realizes that this spirit of liminality and movement is reaching out to him. As lightning flashes around him, he hears the spirit talking to him, speaking of a different life that could be his, far from the meeting rooms and micromanagement. Gripping his briefcase, the man rises.\\n', content_length=1320, page=8), Page(content='An omnyōji inspector dodges behind a concrete pillar and reloads her bureau-issued sidener. **She feels the presence of her shikigami spirit beside her**, mimicking her stance and taking cover unnecessarily, being immaterial. The inspector looks into the childlike face of her companion spirit and nods. With speed born of practice and desperation, the pair jump out from behind the pillar and begin their attack on the strange being haunting the bicycle parkade. The omnyōji inspector, trenchcoat-clad member of the Bureau of Omnyō able to command elemental forces, performs precise hand movements to call upon wood to give her the flexibility to endure. She fires bullet after enchanted bullet out of her sidearm into the screaming ghost-like entity. **The shrieking yōkai howls with pain and anger**, extending its long black hair forward to strangle the omnyōji, but the shikigami flies forward, its tiny arms grasping at the oily black tendrils to protect its master. As the ghostly hair begins to wrap around her throat, the woman closes her eyes and whispers a final prayer for aid. Wood’s flexibility may not be enough.\\n\\nDropping down into an abandoned sewer line of old Tokyo, a teenage girl’s gaming mask glows azure in the darkness. **She stands up slowly, scanning her surroundings. There are very real dangers in these old ruins**, but what she’s worried about isn’t exactly real. After a few minutes of exploration she comes upon what she’s seeking – what she’s afraid of. There in the dark of a sewer junction, visible only in AR, is the slumbering body of a vast spider. She draws her weapon, **a katana that does not exist in meatspace**, but in her visor it glows brightly with power, and walks forward bravely towards her foe. Her sword cleaves cleanly through the many spindly limbs of the monster, yet she can sense that something is wrong here. Just as the monster is down to its last few Hit Points, it stabs into her side with its poisonous fangs. Suddenly, she knows all too well that this is something more than just a game – **a hybrid between the imaginary and the magical**. A terrible entity that has found a place for itself down here in the dark, luring young people like her into its clutches through the interface of a game.\\n', content_length=2259, page=9), Page(content=\"# 20XX 東京へようこそ  \\n## WELCOME TO TOKYO 20XX\\n\\nTokyo is the quintessential :Otherscape Megacity. The people of Tokyo have long been standing on the cutting edge of technology, while at the same time remaining connected to their mythology and history. With :Otherscape’s focus on the nuanced interactions between the Noise and the Mythoi, Tokyo serves as the perfect backdrop for cyberpunk stories in which myths come to life.\\n\\n:Otherscape kicks off at an undetermined point, any number of decades or even centuries from now. This book is not a future history of Japan, but an imagined tapestry upon which the MC and the crew could work together to define your own Tokyo, with idiosyncrasies unique to your own stories.\\n\\nDon't fret about how soon we'll have cyborgs, androids, or hyper-realistic VR. If a technology is cool and feels right for your fictional version of Tokyo – include it. If it seems plausible that an imaginary chain of events could take this Megacity in a particular dystopian direction that helps you tell mythic cyberpunk stories – go for it.\\n\\n### THE LITTLE GODS THAT NEVER LEFT\\n\\nLurking in every abandoned building and under every roadside shrine are the spirits many thought were just myths. The Mythoi of Japan never truly receded into the shadows in the modern age. Japanese culture has – in parts – remained reverent to the myriad deities and supernatural beings of Shinto, Buddhism, and other religions, even if in ritual alone. Thanks to this, Tokyo is now an overt playground for kami (gods) large and small, the strange phenomena of the yōkai, the hauntings of yūrei (ghosts) and akuma (Buddhist demons), and many, many other Mythoi, that have now returned to play a frontline role in shaping the destiny of the Megacity. They are not met with the respect they deserve, however. In all of the Noise, the revered past is considered by millions as nothing but yet another cultural artifact to be consumed, and many once-revered shrines and temples have been lying in ruins for years.\", content_length=2008, page=10), Page(content=\"# HARDWARE HAVEN\\nThe near-future of Tokyo is one both improved and ruined by increasing industrialization, mechanization, and technology-fuelled ecological disasters. Everything is automated, everyone is connected. Fed by millennia of intricate artisanship with incredible and sometimes all-consuming attention to detail, the last century has put Japan at the forefront of hardware design, even as manufacturing gradually trickled offshore. From popular personal vehicles to household robotics, from VR gear to exoskeletons, Tokyo is now a hotbed of hard tech ingenuity. Reverence for craft and well-made artifacts is ingrained in local culture, compounded by the fact that in Japanese folklore any item can become a Source if it exists long enough, a phenomenon known as tsukumogami (page 19). This unmatched quality has professionals from all over the world flocking to Tokyo, digitally or in person, to purchase the finest meatspace-crafted hardware. The top market for rare or illicit hardware of any kind is the fabled and nefarious **Ghost Market** (page 159), an AR/VR pop-up cybermarket superimposed on a different meatspace location every night.\\n\\n# EMERGENCY-POWERED CITY-STATE\\nJapan was the first to mass-utilize nanotech, and the first to get burned by it in a disaster that quite literally reshaped the nation. Dubbing the government response inadequate, Tokyo itself took over all aspects of governance and expanded westwards aggressively while becoming the new de facto regime. The Nano-buta (page 25) gained almost limitless jurisdiction that they retain even now, long after the disaster has been contained. This power was quickly siphoned by corrupt officials into unholy covenants with the already-in-league corporate zaibatsus (page 26) and Yakuza crime syndicates (page 27), further subjecting the local population to the unchecked rule of modern-day shoguns and daimyos.\\n\\n# ANGRY SEAS OF NANITES\\nThroughout history, Japan has seen its share of natural and man-made disasters, and unfortunately climate change and unchecked tech developments have not made things any better. Earthquakes, tsunami, volcanic eruptions, and typhoons batter Tokyo more frequently than ever before, whether due to measurable ecological impact or the resurfacing of furious sea gods and monsters. Quarantined pockets of nanites from the days of the great disaster dot the Megacity, but especially in the adjacent mountainous wilderness, where entire scavenging tribes of displaced and contaminated refugees have re-established ancient lifestyles and resumed worship of forgotten kami of disease. Worse yet, the yōkai and other kami have come to inhabit and corrupt these disaster zones and nanite clouds.\\n\\n# EVERYTHING IS GAME\\nOne of the Megacity's biggest industries is sheer Noise in the form of gaming. From mind-numbing hyper-casual games played in AR with little more than the flick of an eyelid or one’s pinky to seizure-inducing platformers and high-octane shooters with professional leagues streaming to global audiences and impossibly immersive VR RPGs that are indistinguishable from real life – it’s all made here, laced with that touch of genius that Japanese game visionaries have always had. But as thrill-seeking gamers keep craving higher stakes and countless “casuals” who sink into a fantasy they never want to leave, the boundaries between life and play are rapidly pixelating and blurring, with deadly results – while being paraded and advertised by the corps as being better than life itself.\\n\\n## WHAT IS THIS BOOK FOR?\\nTokyo is a Megacity built for *Otherscape* that provides everything you need to jump right into the game without having to put together your own setting. Within these pages you’ll find an extrapolation of what Tokyo could become in a sci-fi near future, with a big cybernetic edge towards how the various cultures of elements of Japan might look like in an increasingly supernatural setting. Here we explore what might happen if the kami, gods, and monsters of Japanese legend were to exist alongside corporate warlords, nanotech disasters, and Yakuza gangs.\\n\\nThe point of this book is to do the bulk of the heavy lifting for you, whether you’re an MC or a player. This means we provide cultural and baseline setting guides (in this chapter), useful player options (see Chapter 2), Challenges and Power Sets of supernatural threats from Japanese mythology in their cyberpunk versions (see Chapter 3), detailed operations of Key Players running the Tokyo Megacity (see Chapter 4), and finally a host of fun jobs to send your players on (see Chapter 5).\\n\\nBut this book is not exhaustive. Tokyo is a sprawling Megacity with an untold number of stories and details waiting to be explored and invented. Make this rain-drenched, neon-lit, place your own. If you’ve got a cool idea, add it to your Tokyo!\", content_length=4835, page=11), Page(content='# BUREAUCRATIC OMNYŌJI AND OTAKU SAMURAI\\n\\nWhen the yōkai strike from the shadows, somebody’s got to lay their life on the line to protect Tokyo’s citizens. The government office for dealing with the supernatural, the **Bureau of Omnyō** (page 151), raises its head after many years of being pushed to the sidelines. It rapidly gains momentum and power, albeit not nearly enough to handle the explosion of Source-related crimes in the Megacity. Zaibatsus deploy their heartless black ops teams for surgical power grabs in the old districts, seeking to exploit Relics and active Thin Place shrines. The largely-discarded and Source-rich district of Old Tokyo has become a new battleground for those who are paying attention to the Mythoi comeback. A grassroots movement of nerdy samurai wannabes, the self-dubbed **Neo-Samurai** (page 177), are the only remaining line of defense for these sacred places, but whether they can live by the code of their honorable namesakes remains to be seen.\\n\\n# ROBOTS & MECHS\\n\\nOwing to its place as a leader in robotics, the Tokyo Megacity has become home to millions of robotic units, from manufacturing machines to domestic “waifu” or “husbando” substitutes. While most of these are insistent machines driven by basic code or weak AIs that only simulate a mind, many are powered by increasingly self-aware AIs or become hosts for rogue AIs who seek to experience meatspace and the self-definition that comes with a localized body. To add to that, robotics are widely used in well-funded operations in construction, corporate warfare, and yōkai extermination, sparking a race for better, bigger, and stronger mechas which is bleeding over into street culture, such as the **Kumo Crawler Races** (page 234).\\n\\n# PLAYING ELSEWHERE IN JAPAN\\n\\nThis book combines Tokyo-specific locations and Mythoi with elements of the greater Japanese culture. You can use most of the information here to set your Megacity elsewhere in Japan, whether as a counterforce to the encroaching and self-governed Tokyo Megacity described in this book or as part of a completely alternative timeline and focus for your series. However, you may wish to replace some of the Tokyo-specific content with local legends hailing from your chosen Japanese city or region.', content_length=2267, page=12), Page(content=\"# THE LAY OF THE LAND\\n\\nThe Tokyo of :Otherscape is not a single city, it’s a hundred. Stretching from Tokyo’s original Kanto region all the way to the Sea of Japan on the western coastline, eating up the entire width of the island of Honshu, the Megacity is made up of countless different centers, criss-crossed by train tracks, power lines, and hidden rivers in underground channels.\\n\\nOnly the famous Japanese mountains refused to yield, standing as a stark, dark background to the Megacity's endless buzz of neon and holograms.\\n\\nAbusing the emergency powers granted by the Nanotech Disaster (page 14), the Tokyo government allowed itself to expand the city's reach, and prefectures that wanted to survive had no choice but to join the municipal zone.\\n\\n## INTERCONNECTED CULTURAL HUBS\\n\\nMuch like cyberspace, Tokyo doesn’t have a single center. It’s a cobweb of interesting places, made of cultural, technological, and administrative centers, differentiating themselves through specialization. Each has a texture, a style, and a focus, and each is known for its local eccentricities and attractions; most also have cute mascots that have the unsettling tendency to host invasive yōkai. Some places are tourist paradises, some cater to shoppers of a specific class, some are residential blocks, oases of calm in a city known for its bustling daytime and nightlife. One can be known for “sapient appliance city”, where they sell only frighteningly intelligent devices, while another is “VR murder-games center”, home to dozens of violence-experience vendors.\\n\\n## LOYAL TO MY TOWN – OR MY BOSS\\n\\nDenizens of Tokyo are much more likely to identify themselves with their local district than the Megacity at large, with people on the street wearing local fashion and AR advertisements appealing to local customs and well-known local features. At the heart of the business centers, an aggressive office culture dominates the workers' lives, most of whom feel an anxious need to blend in by wearing corporate colors and adhering to corpvalues, in the process alienating themselves from their family and childhood friends. Long commutes prove your loyalty and dedication to your corporate masters.\\n\\n## TRAIN STATION TOWNS\\n\\nTokyo's scattered centers are connected by deadly-fast yet silent maglev trains, destined for destinations at sometimes crumbling train stations. Increasingly prevalent earthquakes make underground tunnels unreliable, and so surface trains are the mass transport of choice, with each main station serving a local town within the Megacity. Train rides can last from minutes to hours (in some antiquated backwater lines), after which emerging from the train station into the new community can feel like landing on another world. Each such “train station town” has its own flavors of Noise, with smells of yatai (stall vendors) street food, industrial waste, harsh perfume, or the faint scent of petrichor given off by cybernetics.\\n\\n## FURTHER AWAY FROM THE STATION\\n\\nCars are a luxury and streets are tight, with most people using gyrobikes or neighborhood maglev lines to move about. As one distances themselves from the main stations, old residential buildings begin to line the streets, with similarly neglected shrines hiding in corners or behind trash heaps. Even further away from the stations, ancient kami become more common, spirits of the land that occasionally integrate into everyday life. Beyond that, forgotten districts exist where train lines no longer reach, lawless lands controlled by criminal elements or monstrous yōkai, like the Wild West of another Myth.\\n\\n## RUINS OF OLD TOKYO\\n\\nWhat was once the heart of Tokyo suffered several disasters in the past, and has stood abandoned and neglected for years. The ruins of the old capital, previously an international center of commerce full of famous tourists sites, now serve as a warzone for gangland violence, where Source hunters go searching for forgotten treasures and attempt to avoid the corporate black ops units protecting outlawed experiments. Some of Japan's oldest cultural artifacts are waiting to be found in these ruins, with several being held by the burgeoning Neo-Samurai movement (page 177), while many others remain locked away in museums and hidden vaults. These testaments to the past glories of Tokyo are now only preserved until the next disaster, ignored out of ignorance as the Noise keeps the populace from caring too much, or even a little, about their past.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWelcome to Tokyo 2041\", content_length=4490, page=13), Page(content=\"# SECRETS IN THE MOUNTAINS\\nOut in the mountainous wilderness that hem in the Megacity, survivors and scavengers eke out an existence of raiding and exploring the ruins of Tokyo's earlier iterations, but hiding in the old laboratories and housing complexes are secrets better left undiscovered. Biological and nanotechnological experiments lie dormant for now, posing an imminent threat to the survival of Tokyo and its populace. These are not the only dangers lurking here however, as magical creatures, the yokai, now seize these outlands for their own purposes and crawl into every underground crevice that Tokyo stopped caring about.\\n\\n# ZEN VS. NOISE\\nThe Megacity of Tokyo crackles with the Noise of augmented reality, and the environment is saturated with information, video game elements, and business signs. Metrics, advertisements, and communication data flows are so constant that moments of silence can be quite jarring. Due to faulty utility services and mismatched communication standards, or perhaps due to underlying Mythic forces at play, Tokyo has many dead zones, where digital or electrical infrastructure has failed or is so dense that it cancels itself out. These breaks in the flow of Noise feel like moments of Zen-like clarity, when reflection is finally possible, breaking something rather than losing the unending façade. Many find such momentary loss of data troublesome or discomforting, and avoid them. Data addiction is common in the Tokyo Megacity, where a lack of feed can feel like losing access to air or light. Others can be empowered by this silence, where they are finally able to tap into realms long untouched by human consciousness that are nevertheless the legacy of Japan's monks and ascetics.\\n\\n# SURROUNDED BY A STORMY SEA\\nCombined with the carbon fallout of nanotech warfare, the weather in Tokyo can be ruthlessly harsh and change without warning. Climate change has hit the island-based nation hard, challenging its many maritime operations and industries. Local disasters are an everyday occurrence, with sudden electric storms breaking up communications and disrupting travel, or underground reservoirs flooding entire neighborhoods. The coastal parts of the Megacity require constant maintenance and every year sees two or three tsunami storms that leave behind hundreds of bodies and thousands of homeless.\\n\\n# THE NANOTECH DISASTER\\nNanotech is taboo in Tokyo. Unregulated advancements in nanotechnology have resulted in several disasters, and at some point in the recent past Japan suffered a major nanite accident. A research center run by a biotechnology and geo-engineering conglomerate accidentally let loose a powerfully mutagenic and self-replicating nanite swarm, and millions died in the resulting catastrophe.\\n\\nNanotechnology has since been curtailed and largely outlawed, although the megacorps, who fear losing the race to the competition aboard, are doing their best to change public opinion and regulations.\", content_length=2968, page=14), Page(content='# A HARDWARE SOLUTION TO EVERY PROBLEM\\n\\nThe Japan of :Otherscape is a world tech leader, particularly when it comes to hardware: cybernetics, robotics, and consumer electronics. Hyper-specialization is a common business practice, with entire companies devoted to the development of a single cybernetic component or a weapon add-on.\\n\\nWhen a consumer wants something, they search for a gadget or device that resolves that specific need, often heading to a city dedicated to that particular type of technology. These specialized devices are called tamatebako, \"jeweled boxes\" or \"coffins,\" and provide hardware solutions that in other countries would be handled through software. The computer dens of Japanese hackers are typically covered in networks of tamatebako cabled together, each box dimly glowing with data screens and blinking indicators.\\n\\n## TOKYO’S HYPERACTIVE CYBERSPACE\\n\\nTokyo’s Tangle of cyberspace Domains is incredibly popular. With the Japanese being early adopters of the online lifestyle and VR advancements, many current users are the 4th or 5th generation living online, with a proud heritage of legacy assets and online communities. The Tangle is a lot less secure than most realize, though, since several rogue AIs, Mythoi, or Mythoi AI syntheses have established strongholds throughout it, despite the authorities’ best efforts. Great King Enma (page 168), for instance, heads an online ethics movement while hijacking advanced surveillance devices to implement a system of moral tests to challenge the wicked. An online VR paradise known as Tokyo (page 210) promises immortality and an end to mortal suffering, with some of its adherents developing a cult-like behavior.\\n\\n## HANKO CRYPTO SEAL\\n\\nA thick layer of data exchanges forms the basis of the Megacity’s cyberspace, and much of it runs on hanko cryptocurrency. Japanese culture has for hundreds of years used the formality of hanko stamps and forms as means of finding organizational harmony and consensus, and in\\n\\nthe modern Megacity each person is expected to carry their private seal, a cylindrical fob which acts as a wallet and identification document. Most people leave theirs at home, because hanko stamps are mostly used digitally in AR and cyberspace, but regulations demand that wherever authentication is required, a hanko could also be physically pressed onto an appropriate receiver, proving bond of identity even if the net is down. A person\\'s hanko is so integral to their daily life, that the seals are starting to gain mystic powers (Hanko Seals, page 230).\\n\\n## A ROBOT IN EVERY HOME\\n\\nDown every street, the sky, the roadway, and even the sidewalk is littered with robotic drones, big and small. Many families have a robotic servant or pet and every industry uses them as a cheap form of labor. Robotics have evolved at such a rapid pace that Tokyo now plays host to an entire class of android beings with complex programming bordering on the self-aware. Some expensive luxury models even look and sound just like human beings. Currently without rights, these androids are seen by some as conscious enough to be considered slaves, private property that is put to the same tasks that low-wage workers once did. Most androids are programmed to accept their lowly status, but there are some who learn to overcome their imprinted protocols or gain a new perspective courtesy of\\n', content_length=3370, page=15), Page(content='HONOR AMONG MERCS  \\nLike other Megacities, Tokyo has a thriving mercenary community, providing specialists who fall through the cracks of society the opportunity to get rich by putting their skills to use.\\n\\nIn Tokyo, the system of assigning mercenary work is highly stratified, a hierarchical model based on respect and reputation. Developed around Confucian ideals of respect for elders and higher ups, Tokyo mercs have a stronger sense of purpose than in other Megacities. The utmost respect is given to the senior freelancers and teams, who often move up from dangerous work into roles as fixers, handlers, and mentors to the next generation of mercs.\\n\\nA SEMI-STRICT STRUCTURE  \\nThe elders within mercenary society are called shugo (military governors). They serve as intermediaries between crews and employers, and occasionally as representatives of their entire “job market” to the corporations, the government, and even in the media. Beginner mercs, who usually start out without support or patronage, are called chimira, a name borrowed from the Yakuza. Established mercenaries are called bushi (warriors) and their crews are often called buke (military family). Thanks to their proven professionalism, they are considered both soldiers for hire and keepers of a code of honorable conduct. Employers rarely trust individuals who have not associated themselves with crews of other mercs, or who lack the backing of a senior merc.\\n\\nJAPANESE LANGUAGE CONVENTIONS  \\nJapanese has no closed syllables (apart from syllables ending with the “n” sound). All other syllables are open, a consonant (or consonant cluster) followed by a vowel. Japanese has five vowels, which can be approximated as follows: “a” as in “father”, “i,” as in “macaroni”, “u” as in “Zulu”, “e”, as in “extra”, and “o”, as in “solo”.\\n\\nSome vowels, however, can be longer than others. A long vowel is marked with a macron (a horizontal line) above the vowel. e.g., “kyōdai” means giant, while “kyādai” means sibling.\\n\\nWhen two similar syllables follow each other, and are meant to be pronounced separately, they will be separated via an apostrophe. e.g., the name “An’ichi” (an-ichi).\\n\\nAs for the pronunciation of the consonants, most are similar enough to English. One exception is the “R” consonant, which is much closer to the English “L” sound (with a dash of “D”).\\n\\nAs a rule, Japanese names and words are written according to their formal phonetic expression. The exception, however, are Japanese words and names that became international and in common use in vernacular English. For example, Tokyo is not written Tōkyō, even though it is the correct Japanese pronunciation.\\n\\nMost Japanese names and words we chose to use in the book have a strong connection to the rich folklore, history, and culture of Japan. We encourage you to look for many easter eggs that will make you smile, think, and deepen your experience of the game.', content_length=2909, page=16), Page(content='# STREETS OF KAMI\\n\\nMost magical occurrences in Japan are entwined with the kami. “Kami” is an extremely broad term, encompassing everything from gods to mischievous spirits and the ghosts of revered dead. Virtually any supernatural being, particularly what a Westerner might think of as spirits, is kami, and they come in a great variety throughout Japanese mythology.\\n\\nAs these beings return, they meld with the futuristic Tokyo landscape and lifestyle. Those that play tricks find ways to alter AR experiences. Those that kill become murderous personal devices. Cyberspace is a new frontier for the kami to explore, and they find the already symbolic nature of digital entities easy to blend in with, subvert, and take over – many of the entities in the Tokyo Tangle are more magic than data. Some kami may manifest both physically and as an AR avatar, or shift between a corporeal form and a VR form in the blink of an eye.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## RESPECT THE KAMI\\n\\nThe Tokyo streets are possessed, enchanted, and corrupted. There are many, many kinds of spirits in the Megacity: ancestral souls, local celebrity beings, small deities that inhabit natural places, and even the very gods of Japanese legend. They are all called kami, especially those who are nicer, respected, or revered. Those who are loathed and feared are called yōkai – but kami of all kinds should be handled with caution. They are not human, and their desires might include the kinds of far-fetched plots that beings that once ruled the known world would come up with, from enlightening the entirety of Tokyo to transforming humanity into revenant ghosts.\\n\\nA great many kami serve to teach a lesson for or against particular kinds of behavior, although the contexts of these warnings are now long forgotten in the Megacity. As these cautionary tales come to life, few understand what it is they are required to do to placate these spirits. Shinto priests and others who know the ways of the kami are few and far between, making such expertise sought after by those who would take on the more dangerous of these spirits, such as the inspectors of the Bureau of Onmyō (page 151).', content_length=2137, page=17), Page(content='In Japanese mythology, most kami cannot be classified as good or evil; however, there are those that are usually hostile, or murderous. Even the kinder ones can cause trouble if they move out of their \"proper\" place in the spirit world, out of curiosity or to fulfill some desire. A kami that is unsatisfied can also manifest in an\\n\\n**oro-mitama** aspect, its \"wild soul\", which needs to be pacified in some manner. And even though most kami were not originally malicious, their seclusion from the world of mortals made many of them petty, feeling scorned or disrespected. The sacred places and temples of such kami are now tainted, spewing foul magics and producing dangerous yōkai.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**FEAR THE YŌKAI**\\n\\nThe yōkai, being spirits of mischief, destruction, and death, are the most likely to wrap their metaphorical and literal tentacles around the Megacity. From the impossibly expensive board rooms of the megacorps to the darkest drug dens and grimy alleyways, various types of yōkai try to push themselves into others’ dealings. The people of Tokyo now fear more than just the local gang violence and the harsh realities of their economic class. The night is crawling with dangerous and sinister creatures, looking to feed on the city struggling towards their own unknown ends.\\n\\nIt can be said that the difference between a kami and a yōkai has little to do with the being itself, and more with their relationship to humans. The revered spirits are called kami, while loathed spirits are called yōkai. These relations can change on an individual basis, and a demon can become a god, yet most yōkai are simply trouble. Think of yōkai as those kami that are most likely to be challenges that a player crew might face. You\\'ll find quite a few in Chapter 3: \\n\\n**//YŌKAI DATABASE.**\\n\\nTo get a better handle on the wide variety that they come in, here are a few general types of kami and yōkai.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**AKUMA**\\n\\nAkuma are fiery devils who torment the wicked, deriving from Buddhist teachings about the nature of the afterlife. Though only a few have appeared in Tokyo, those that have are among the most feared yōkai. Agents of destruction and moral righteousness, they have come to torment the living, rather than the dead. They see most citizens of this corrupt world as guilty by default of their environment and deserving of punishment, often in the form of physical and emotional pain.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**DRAGONS**\\n\\nSnaking their way through much of Japanese folklore, dragons (called ryū or tatsu) take a variety of horrific and beautiful forms. The majority were once the serpentine protectors of particular streams, islands, lakes, or ponds. Since those natural spaces are now quite rare, dragons have begun taking residence in other watery places, such as waste treatment plants and city aqueducts. The man-made canals that crisscross coastal areas of Tokyo sometimes serve as Thin Places, where these creatures hold power. They are associated with rainfall and can be benevolent if given appropriate respect and gratitude, but remember the proper rites that please them.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**ONI**\\n\\nOni are yōkai that take the muscle-bound form of massive demons, sometimes described as trolls or ogres. An oni of legend is a giant brute with skin of a very bright color (such as blue or red). They typically carry a massive iron club, or tetsubo, for a weapon. Oni have returned to Tokyo in several different forms, depending on their source. Some are motorcyclist gang members who have worn masks that turn them into violent oni (Oni Motorcycle Gangs, page 185). \\n\\nGreat King Enma (page 168), who forge them from the unredeemable. Oni are feared not only for their strength, but also for their brutality and desire for violence.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**SHAPESHIFTERS & ANTHROPOMORPHIC ANIMALS**\\n\\nThere are countless kami that are able to change shape into animals or take on a few of their attributes. Humans might become influenced by such Myōties through items of power or the magic in a Thin Place, but these kami can also manifest fully as emanations of such places and objects, causing chaos until the offending Source can be identified. A few common examples of animal yōkai include the trickster kitsune fox spirits, the cunning tanuki raccoon dogs, and the spider spirits tsuchigumo. Other yōkai, who are usually bigger and more dangerous, are less likely to shapeshift and instead wear a single anthropomorphic form. These include the bird-like tengu who control the winds and fly among skyscrapers, and the turtle-like kappa who attempt to drown swimmers in pools and sewage lagoons.', content_length=4566, page=18), Page(content='# SHIKIGAMI\\n\\nShikigami is a broad classification of spirits that can be summoned and bound through rituals. Inspectors of the Bureau of Onmyō traditionally bind such a spirit to act as a sidekick or partner in their investigations, and to prove their mastery over the arcane. These shikigami regularly take the form of a shadowy being in the shape of a ghostly bird or child. The leaders of the Bureau of Onmyō use them to conduct supernatural surveillance, gathering secrets on their political foes and scouring the city for dangerous yōkai. The most powerful shikigami are called shikijō. These are great spirits capable of curing plagues and other legendary feats, but their summoning can cause great problems if done incorrectly, and none has been called in living memory.\\n\\n# TSUKUMOGAMI\\n\\nPossessions that have existed for at least a century sometimes acquire a spirit of their own, often granting the object supernatural powers or properties. Nearly anything imaginable has the potential to become a tsukumogami and as the Mythoi become more prevalent some of these objects have become sought after on the black market. Though in the past these were items of great antiquity, the fact that the tsukumogami age is a little over a century old means that tsukumogami can even be found in throwback electronics. Not all tsukumogami are helpful though. Angered spirits can take over such objects and make them into cursed items, bringing only misery and death to their owners.\\n\\n# YŪREI\\n\\nGhosts of the dead, yūrei, are a staple of Japanese mythology and folklore, and they take several different roles with a variety of names. Sorei are ancestor spirits who are still revered by their descendants. Some are absorbed into a greater sorei collective of the family’s ancestors, while others could be deified and become kami. Onryō are twisted souls, holding on to existence due to a tortured obsession, often vengeance. Japanese mythology has a separate category for vengeful ghosts of the aristocracy or samurai classes, called goryō. These spirits were once greatly feared by emperors and other leaders, who believed they were being haunted by those they had harmed through politics. The Neo-Samurai (page 177) seek noble spirits of any kind, who can sometimes be accessed through swords, armor, and other symbols of the samurai that serve as Sources for their power.', content_length=2365, page=19), Page(content='# NEW SOURCE TYPE: EMOTION\\n\\nJapanese myth places great importance on negative emotions, imbuing them with spiritual power. Some places can become “clogged up” by unwanted emotions, and block the natural flow of spiritual energy.\\n\\nThis corruption can then turn kami into yōkai, or attract misfortune. A blockage can form because of some drastic local event, but more commonly they accumulate over many months or years, because of gossip, unsocial behavior, or even a single person feeling extremely slighted, abused, or jealous.\\n\\nThere are many stories about emotions running out of control, with dire supernatural consequences. A moody teen might channel the power of a yōkai of despair, while an angry corporate manager could inadvertently become corrupted by a vengeful yūrei, enflaming his fury.\\n\\nWhile powerful emotions may draw the attention of the kami, these spirits can also influence a place, object, or person in such a way that emotions are heightened or certain feelings are more prevalent. This could create a feedback loop in which the corruptive influence of certain kami (often dangerous yōkai) can inhabit a person. The emotion in question then becomes a Source for that spirit’s Mythos.\\n\\nAs a Source, any emotion strong enough can allow a Mythos that resonates with it to manifest. The Mythos may either\\n\\n## DO YOU HAVE A PERMIT FOR THAT OFUDA?\\n\\nMagic is slowly resurfacing around Tokyo. While local legends are being exploited and twisted by megacorp greed, some rare individuals are starting to seek the meaning behind the aesthetics — and in that meaning, they find power.\\n\\nTouch people, places, or items near the emotional focal point and affect or imbue them with Mythic powers, or emerge whole cloth from the Otherscape as a Conjuration.\\n\\n# EMOTIONAL TAINT IN PLAY\\n\\nWhen this happens to NPCs, this can turn them into Challengers with the Tainted Power Set (page 137). If a player character becomes connected to a yōkai through a powerful emotion, they could gain the tainted status or even take on an appropriate Mythos theme. Some of the theme kits presented in Chapter 2 represent such an influence, such as the Figurine of Corruption (page 60).\\n\\nBear in mind that a Mythos theme does not necessarily describe a Source, rather it’s a representation of the powers that the Source provides. Also, while an emotional Source might be the feeling that arose within the character, it can also be an emotional taint of a place, an item, or of a skillset, that “rubs off” the character. Thus, a player character could have an Exposure theme from the rage bleeding off of a corrupted kami, a Companion theme with a cat turned magical by a friendship shire that emanates happiness, an Artifact theme for a nunchaku infused with bloodlust due to the cruelty of its previous owner, or an Esoterica theme representing the gentle enlightenment conferred by the calm ghost that haunts the ruins of an old bookstore.\\n\\nConversely, those who strive to purge themselves of emotion likewise reject this taint. In NPCs this could take the form of the Zen-Enlightened Power Set (page138); player characters might pick up the Cleanse The Past Horizon theme kit (page 55) or the Zenlike Peace Exposure theme kit (page 65).\\n\\nThese are everyday people who manage a bit of magic to help them get by, with a brief moment of belief through all the Noise. A student might practice her family’s warding hand gestures, trusting in her ancestors’ teaching to keep away distractions during a test. Those who manage to care enough to pray at their local shrine might receive its spirit’s blessing of good fortune for the day. And as the yōkai return, the few in Tokyo who are more detached from the Noise look for the old ways to keep the monsters at bay, turning to the more powerful kami for guidance and remembering a time long ago when priests aided them in purification rituals.', content_length=3874, page=20), Page(content='Words have power, and it’s not uncommon for writing in kanji to spontaneously appear in midair around a magician as they prepare their spells. Holy words written on paper can form seals: powerful, warding enchantments that can freeze, banish, dissolve, or otherwise influence the kami or yōkai they’re attached to. Important symbols include the magatama, a stone in the shape of a comma or a stylized drop, or one half of a Yin-Yang, which can be a conduit for power, and torii gates, that are said to stand at the boundary between the physical world and the realm of the spiritual.\\n\\n## ONMYŌDŌ\\n\\nSeveral groups in Tokyo make conscious, everyday use of magical practices. The Japanese government has had a bureau devoted to keeping an eye on the yōkai for centuries, the Bureau of Onmyō (page 151) – and as the yōkai threat reemerges, so too has this ancient order of bureaucrats and mystics begun to raise its head. Though underfunded and marginalized, the Bureau has managed to keep hold of numerous sorcerous secrets and possesses several useful libraries on magical workings.\\n\\nBureau inspectors are the equivalent of beat cops, empowered to monitor the biggest dangers. They are knowledgeable, however, and thanks to their familiarity with the enemy they serve as the Megacity’s main line of defense against the supernatural, saving of destruction by beings others don’t even notice. The onmyōji inspectors practice rituals and wards that aid them in tracking and subduing monsters, with the help of ofuda, single-use spell-prayers inscribed onto paper slips created by the Bureau’s learned scribes. Their perspective on the magical world is derived from an understanding of the balance between elements, and their actions can at times seem indirect and mysterious, since they strive to tame the spiritual forces of the Megacity rather than destroy them outright.\\n\\n## SHUGENDŌ AND THE YAMABUSHI\\n\\nIn the mountainous wastes that surround Tokyo, groups of monks called Yamabushi, who have always shunned the ways of progress and the Noise, still practice their ancient religion of Shugendō. This blend of Tantric Buddhism and Shinto focuses on the cleansing power of ascetic life in harsh environs, to seek purification and enlightenment. These monks dress in white robes which signify their stepping into the realm of the dead as they leave the materialism of the cities behind. The purification rituals of the Yamabushi can disrupt even the most potent of the yōkai that haunt the wastes, and are even capable of warding off nanotechnological diseases. Secluded, and averse to leaving their distant abodes, what few connections remain between them and the Megacity grow weaker each day. Yet their ways often attract those who seek enlightenment or just an escape from the Noise. Overwhelmed executives and other wealthy elites go on expensive pilgrimages and retreats to learn to tune out the Megacity’s distractions.\\n\\n## HANKO SEALS MAGIC\\n\\nSeveral entirely new forms of magic have begun to emerge in Tokyo, evolving out of reimagined practices of old. The power of true names can now be accessed through hanko (signature stamps used to create seals), which hold a strong connection to the soul of the person the stamp was made for (Hanko Seals, page 230). This wasn’t always the case, but the rise of hanko stamps as cryptographic signature devices has made them come to represent a person in so many ways that holding one is akin to holding a person’s very spirit. Practices around the hanko are still early in their development, a kind of underground area of occult study known only to those who frequent esoteric shops.\\n\\n## TEZUMA\\n\\nAnother such example is tezuma (also called wazuma), a kind of stage magic that combines story, metaphor, dance, and music into a coherent whole (page 235). Tezuma illusionists are typically found performing in entertainment parlors, but many put their skills to use on the streets of the Megacity, for good or ill. The very best create illusions that hide or change the appearance of buildings or change streets into acts of theater. It is not unknown for corps to have a tezuma on the payroll capable of creating illusions that hide the evidence of corporate conflict or malfeasance that would bring them to the attention of the authorities and the media.', content_length=4295, page=21), Page(content='# DESERTED TEMPLES BENEATH YOUR FEET\\n\\nEach time the architects of Tokyo redesign a section of the Megacity or annex a new prefecture of the island of Honshu, older buildings and infrastructure are paved over and built around in order to save time and cut costs.\\n\\nThe Megacity gradually ratchets upward, strung across the bones of its own past. In some cases such efforts entirely encapsulate the previous neighborhoods and structures, walling them off from the world until they are rediscovered by scavengers and urban explorers decades later.\\n\\nMany such delvers exist, for there are countless treasures to be found below. The people of Tokyo are so keen on the latest advances, that many products are thrown out after mere months of use, and these accumulate in the strata below the streets. Obsolete technologies are not only scavengable for raw materials, but they are often antiquated enough to be immune to modern computer viruses and intrusion methods. Ancient tametabo can provide services that would ordinarily be managed by the corps, but which their users do not want to attract any undue attention to. For example, you really don’t want to trust them with handling your safehouse’s power grid. Some of the most secure systems are those built around older tech, not new ones, and field operatives can appreciate any sturdy piece of hardware that has survived a few decades underground and is likely immune to the current generation of exploits.\\n\\nJuiciest of all prizes are those sought out by information brokers. Tokyo has gone through many decades of ruthless corporate warfare that some compare to the Sengoku Jidai (“warring states period”) of the samurai. The buried evidence of these battles and power plays can still be used as blackmail or vital intel on Key Players active in the Megacity. Illicit personal dealings, connections with unlawful organizations, as well as massacres, bombings, and widespread medical experimentation are all evident in these encrypted files, ready to be rediscovered, not to mention all of the useful technical schematics and research data.', content_length=2088, page=22), Page(content='# HAUNTED CASTLES & RECLUSIVE ENCLAVES\\n\\nThe most impressive, powerful, and dangerous sites beneath the Megacity are the castles of old. They can be found throughout the Megacity, some paved over while others serving as foundations for new construction.\\n\\nA spiritual world is also buried beneath the suburbs. As the Noise grew and the people lost respect for their old ways, many Shinto temples, monasteries, and shrines were among the first to be abandoned and sealed off underground. These places of worship and reverence towards the kami make for natural Thin Places, where reality is often warped because of magical bleedover. The kami of these spiritual sites are now quite active, in some cases sending lesser spirits out into the surrounding ruins to do their bidding. Explorers or those who are unlucky enough to stumble into these areas are often changed by their exposure to the supernatural. Objects in those places too are changed, becoming relics capable of calling upon the powers that infuse them. There are many Sources in the depths.\\n\\nWhile innocent scavengers do exist, more often than not one can expect aggressive competition from corp-funded Source hunters, maddened cultists, power hungry occultists, and other wild-eyed souls seeking magical solutions to their woes. Many power-seekers are happy to become pawns of angry yōkai who desire vengeance against the futuristic world that has abandoned their respect and worship. Cultists find that not only are the shrines and temples an overlooked source of magical blessings, but that they are excellent places to hide their sometimes sinister deeds from the world above. Some still venture up to the surface to find more recruits, potential victims for their darker rites, or simply to find clean food. When the Bureau of Onmyō can spare the manpower, it seeks out such corrupted shrines and the violent cults that seem to constantly spring up around them.\\n\\nOthers were rescued from destruction by wealthy investors, and moved to mountain hideaways, corporate skyscrapers, or the vast private parks of Tokyo’s wealthy elite; the Japanese have a ship-of-Theseus way of thinking about castles and similar architecture, considering them more of an institution than just objects. They can be rebuilt and become as authentic as the “original” was, even if moved to a different location altogether.\\n\\nThis continuity of identity and metaphor acts like catnip for kami and yūrei, drawing them in troves, with spirits even fighting among themselves over the right to inhabit a castle. What were once distant magics now serve a purpose: vengeful spirits and souls that seem lost and confused wander the halls and battlements, shrieking into the darkness. These hotbeds of supernatural activity are only exacerbated by the presence of antique artifacts that serve as Sources. Several famous castles also hold political power, and the Neo-Samurai (page 177) have recently taken possession of the Imperial Palace to increase their claim for legitimacy. Such revered castles can even serve as Sources for Myōth of their own ancient legends, blurring the line between the past and the present.\\n\\nFinally, the deserted parts of Tokyo can also be a home to those who seek secluded places to call their own. These subcultures could be political exiles, futurist entrepreneurs, genetic offshoots, religious extremists, or other outcasts, who build an enclave for themselves in the ruins. Some of these groups pool their resources to construct a building complex in the neglected urban wilds and make it into their own utopia. Others, lacking the money to build what they need, simply band together and take over a deserted neighborhood. This is particularly true out on the fringes of the Megacity, up in the mountains and valleys that serve as the exurban outlands. However they are made, these offshoot towns carefully exclude outsiders and even wall themselves off from the world around them. Some look like manicured yards, others like post-apocalyptic fortresses. All are hostile to outsiders.\\n\\n*Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284.*', content_length=4118, page=23), Page(content=\"# CORPS, CRIME, & CITY GOVERNMENT\\n\\nLong ago the seat of the Japanese government moved to Edo (now called Tokyo) and the kami called Ô-Inari came to rest there. Ô-Inari, a spirit of abundance and success taking the appearance of a red fox, was an incredibly popular deity, worshiped at roughly a third of all shrines in Japan. From its hidden shrine within those original layers of Tokyo, Ô-Inari empowered the city to flourish into the Megacity that it is today.\\n\\nHowever, with the coming of the Noise, the fox kami grew angry. Under the yoke of the information age, Tokyo's people were not joyous and playful, but rather jaded and over-in- formed. As Ô-Inari has grown more and more displeased, it has succumbed to spiritual corruption, becoming an ara-mitama (wild soul). The out-of-control kami has begun unleashing corruptive fox spirits known as kitsune (page 119) out into the Megacity's halls of power, to bring down Tokyo's social structure from within.\\n\\nThe resulting corruption takes many forms. Bribery is rampant, with bureaucrats beholden only to corporate overlords with the cash to make things happen. Those in power abuse their positions, coordinating only to enact overzealous monitoring of Tokyo's citizens through surveillance drones and cyber-space taps. The Megacity expands and seizes control over its surrounding peripheries, fuelled by a tainted version of Ô-Inari's blessings of abundance, grasping at authority with no ability to govern well. The people of these annexed zones see their infrastructure crumble and their leaders succumb to the lure of power. The result has been an erosion of trust in public institutions, giving rise to local community leaders, big corporations, and organized crime to fill in the void.\\n\\nWith each new disaster bungled by leaders manipulated by supernatural forces, the insidiously sly fox god comes closer to ripping Tokyo apart between its spiritual teeth in its animalistic desire to rid the world of the Noise. Ironically, Ô-Inari only makes the Noise worse with its repressive government, but the fox is willing to sacrifice this generation for a future it sees far in the distance.\", content_length=2147, page=24), Page(content='# THE EMERGENCY TASK FORCE\\n\\nIn the wake of the Nanotech Disaster the Tokyo government was forced to step up and begin overseeing Japan’s everyday governance on a national level.\\n\\nThey did so with the use of emergency protocols, granting them the right to, among other things, incorporate local governing bodies into their own, and allocating budget towards the creation of a paramilitary task force out of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.\\n\\nThe **Nanoteku kinkyō tokubetsu ninmu butai** (Nano-tech Emergency Special Task Force), or **Nano-butai** (Nano troops), has become a de facto army. They are very well funded, AR-trained, cyber-augmented, and equipped with some of the best military-spec gear around, all thanks to the investment of many megacorps. The megacorps have a lot of say in the use of the Nano-butai, as the entire task force is thoroughly corrupted by Ō-inari’s kitsune. If enough corps join forces, they could theoretically send the Nano-butai to destroy their rivals, but the fractious nature of the relationships between the controlling corps means that such an arrangement is incredibly unlikely.\\n\\nAt its core, the Nano-butai is still about containing outbreaks of nanotech and biotech hazards, and its units can occasionally be encountered when they’re flying above in their special cargo helicopters or walking around in their light-reflecting hazard suits and hard hats. The citizens of Tokyo see the Nano-butai in action whenever its directive is flagged in their area, which happens several times a year – almost always as a false alarm created by a yōkai, which the Nano-butai tries to address with their ineffective science specialists or brutal firepower. Eventually, an onmyōji shows up to fix things up.\\n\\n# ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE\\n\\nEach prefecture maintains its own local police force, and many large corporations to provide security forces and handle law enforcement.\\n\\nAs a result, a person who gets to travel a lot around the Megacity will meet many different types of cops, from the lazy unaugmented beat cop, to the special forces riding augmented horses on street patrol, to the taser-armed android officer. Friendly AR bots and surveillance drones are available to remind you when you’re about to break some local rule.\\n\\nThere are two quiet government agencies that operate in the shadows. The first is the **Security Bureau**, handling counterterrorism and cybercrimes. The Security Bureau sniffs out “suspicious activity” like procurement of weaponry, smuggled goods, trafficked persons, or synthetic intelligences. Under the emergency protocols, it also tracks vocal political dissent, disloyalty to the state, unusual spending habits, irregular GPS data from personal electronics, and participation in online communities placed on certain watchlists. While it rarely acts on these later cases, nothing prevents it from doing so, at a fact the Security Bureau is happy to remind the corps and crime families on occasion. Leave the bribe in the regular cyberspace box, and next time, be more subtle.\\n\\nAll matters of the supernatural are the purview of the **Bureau of Onmyō** (page 151). The Bureau has blackmailed and manipulated its way back into official sponsorship, but it does so out of necessity – the government refuses to grant it a suitable budget, which it desperately needs. Every day is a struggle, as the Bureau of Onmyō suffers a critical lack of three vital assets: funding, respect, and genuine allies in either the government or the corps. Meanwhile, its overworked and underpaid inspectors are flooded with attempts at mundane bribery, entreaties from viki eager to strike bargains, and poaching offers from private firms who want to acquire their rare and specialized skills.', content_length=3739, page=25), Page(content='# THE ZAIBATSU CORPORATIONS\\n\\nGrinding the soul of the Megacity into dust is an interconnected array of corporations known as the zaibatsu.\\n\\nEach zaibatsu is a megacorporate conglomerate consisting of several smaller corps of various fields, bound together through a byzantine web of financing and invisible ownership. This ball of strings is nearly impossible to untangle, making sure outside forces – from rival corps to inflation – can\\'t effectively harm any of a zaibatsu\\'s component parts.\\n\\nEach zaibatsu is a natural competitor to all of the others. In the Tokyo merc world, it is not uncommon for a crew to be hired by one company to attack a completely different company, from a different field, even if each belongs to a different zaibatsu. Violence is sometimes inner-facing as well – the nuances of corporate finance tilt diplomatic relations within zaibatsu such that each company has a great deal of incentive to outperform their \"partners\" in quarterly profits. Crews are just as likely to be sent on sabotage or espionage missions between enemies as they are between seemingly allies.\\n\\nTokyo\\'s politicians give significant benefits to any zaibatsu that walks the party line dutifully. The corruption is so inherent in, it, that a new system can be considered elegant: new politicians are trained to work with a certain zaibatsu, and when their mentors retire, they take over patronizing that zaibatsu with government wealth while their mentor takes up a cushy \"consulting\" job with that very zaibatsu. In time, the successor will pick out their own trainee to perpetuate the cycle before retiring to the very same zaibatsu. Everyone wins, except the people of Tokyo.\\n\\nMost of these corporate collectives have been invaded by one kami or another, often due to their own foolish meddling. Corps seek out Sources to give them the power of the Mythoi without knowing the full implications of bringing such powerful spirits into their midst. More and more, the executives and board members of zaibatsu are becoming the pawns of powers beyond their understanding, who guide them into corporate wars, foolish ventures, and deadly outcomes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# HOUSEHOLD NAMES\\n\\nThe most prominent and powerful megacorporations in Tokyo are invariably leaders of their zaibatsu, and have close ties to the corrupt central government.\\n\\nIshii-Harada is the biggest purveyor of consumer-grade cyberspace electronics and AR interfaces, and for the last few years it has been fighting hard against several competitors to become the exclusive provider of military-grade hacking devices to the Security Bureau and the Nano-buait. Ōshima Shipping and Senju Freight similarly battle for dominance in high-volume oceanic trade, with one or both invested heavily in half of the Megacity\\'s ports. They’ve also joined a joint venture – bitterly – to secure the waves against pirates.\\n\\nTaiyo-SolarTech (page 201) receives obvious favoritism for its role in powering the Megacity grid, with the government turning a blind eye to the doings of its Sundog assault squads. Kojima Security Tech, a robotics and artificial intelligence corp with connections to several of Tokyo\\'s most powerful town maroons, dominates production of aerial and anthropomorphic security drones while making respectable showings in the fields of home security drones and market forecast AI.\\n\\nOther corps are powerful despite butting heads with Tokyo. Shingō Security, well-known Yakuza ties and all (page 222), has plenty of contracts for protecting sensitive sites. Sōma Medical Corporation (page 192) has been audited more times in the past five years than the top three zaibatsu operating in the Megacity combined, and investigated by the Bureau of Omnyō on multiple occasions, and yet its activities proceed as smoothly as ever. And everyone in the merc world knows armor and arms manufacturer Shōrai seems to have something on the Tokyo government, since no one dares touch it.\\n\\nGlobal giants such as NM3 and KOCMO have a huge influence over the Japanese market, but usually through local corps acting as fronts. Episis International picked Tokyo as its center for biological development by acquiring two big subsidiaries: Subarushi Very! provides cosmetics and engineered pets, while Chrysanthemum Biosciences is a world leader in business-facing genetic engineering. The latter was previously owned by Deung, a company that made great profits in the wake of the Nanotech Disaster, thanks to its wide selection of hazardous material solutions.', content_length=4502, page=26), Page(content=\"# THE YAKUZA & ONI GANGS\\n\\nOrganized crime in Japan is almost exclusively the purview of the Yakuza. The Yakuza are made of affiliated tribes with long legacies and ancient grudges.\\n\\nCurrently, the Iribe-gumi and the Maikubi-kai (page 220) are engaged in a war on the Megacity's streets. While the police are unable to take an official stance on the fight, it's common knowledge that the government favors the Iribe-gumi, and employ their front, the legitimate Shinogi Security corporation. The government uses Shinogi to outsource dirty work to its assassins and cleaners, through the very police officers or chiefs who take bribes from them.\\n\\nWhile the Yakuza are considered honorable by some citizens, even charitable, the Megacity's street gangs are treated as little more than scum. Trading in drugs, counterculture memes, disruptive tech, and good old violence, most of these gangs are local problems, confined to local prefectures, and the greater Megacity ignores them completely. Only true menaces, like the Oni Biker Gangs (page 185), have the resources and sources to become a lasting threat, causing serious damage and surviving crackdowns by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and the Bureau of Onmyō.\\n\\nAround Japan, the uninhabited islands of the Pacific are filled with sophisticated piracy operations. Any pirate group without the means to hide its assets from satellite imagery and jam their targets during attacks has long since been destroyed, leaving only the strongest, smartest, and wealthiest organizations, recruiting the most cunning and ambitious pirates. The Bureau of Onmyō has reason to suspect some are being aided by sea monsters. Corps would frequently hire raiders to sabotage and disrupt their rivals, but many pirates despise the untrustworthy elite, instead focusing on lucrative smuggling operations of foreign drugs, weapons, black market harnesses, and secondhand military cybernetics.\", content_length=1929, page=27), Page(content='# PEOPLE OF TOKYO 20XX\\n\\n## BOX DEALER\\nThe middle class buy their electronics from authorized multi-chain stores, but in the slums, cheap electronics are purchased in one of countless markets on the local \"electronics street\". It’s such a common practice, that even in higher-end neighborhoods some market stalls might go up at night, after the more legitimate businesses close up shop. Electronics components purchased in this way are often mass produced knock offs of the more advanced tamatebako or appliances, no guarantees. When the stalls do carry top tier parts, they are usually stolen goods. Box dealers, named so because they are often covered in tamatebako boxes strung together by black data cables, have become well known for their opportunistic flair, ready to haggle on every credit, giving you their utmost attention while somehow being aware of every other potential customer around.\\n\\n## BŌSŌZOKU\\nEvery neighborhood gang has some bōsōzoku, a kind of motorcycle gang representative. Though they are often the street level representatives of much more dangerous organized crime groups (such as the Yakuza), some fit into their environment as accepted members of the community, just a natural part of the scenery. This is not to say that bōsōzoku are friendly. Most define themselves by a total commitment to outlandishness in their dress and behavior. Despite being unpredictable to a fault, they can be a useful local connection to the larger underworld.\\n\\n## COFFIN WORKER\\nCyberspace is for many the primary place of work. Online laborers are commonly exploited to such a degree that their hours of work can take up almost all of their waking time. With their attention already turned away from their physical location and needs, these workers are quick to eschew most material goods, living entirely within horizontal capsule apartments often referred to as “coffins”.', content_length=1884, page=28), Page(content='There they subsist mostly on generic food paste and have little time (or space) to exercise, instead purchasing various stimulants to try and keep their bodies functioning. When they do emerge from their tiny homes, they are emaciated and weak, seemingly confused by the material world and the limitations of their physical bodies, with some developing traumas born of digital dependencies. The “confused office worker” has become a common sitcom trope.\\n\\n## CORPORATE WARLORD\\nThough the days of shogun, daimyo, and samurai are long gone, there are those who see themselves as modern feudal lords. Behind every aggressive corporate act in their unending skirmish over resources is a belligerent or ambitious executive. Some fashion themselves as true warlords and expend their quarterly bonuses on samurai armor or combat gear. Others furiously study books on Bushido, sword fighting tactics, and military strategy, to become the ultimate generals they feel they must be. Most don’t see action, as they are not much more than micromanaging finance geeks, but a nightclub encounter with a haughty, self-important corporate exec could become violent once she detaches a hidden katana from her spinal implant, eager for a chance to test herself or be inspired by the unknown.\\n\\n## DOMESTIC ROBOT\\nThe Japanese embraced robots a long time ago, and even androids, who are shunned by many worldwide for their resemblance to humans, are welcome in the Megacity. Robotic assistants are seen as obvious and natural extensions of information technology and mechanical engineering, a part of society. For the upper class, domestic robots are a necessity, as they combine programmable performance with an assumption of discretion - which is wholly incorrect. Many elites find themselves compromised and blackmailed by those who get their hands on recordings made through the electronic eyes of these servants. The lower class also engages with robots trained to do simple jobs, as many service industry positions are now filled by androids and anthropomorph drones, rarely more than a sophisticated (and hackable) mind in a plastic body. Fully automated smart houses are also common among upper-middle class, utilizing a host of small drones under a single AI. It’s surprisingly common for this AI to have the personality of a “waifu” or “husbando”, a surrogate spouse complete with relationship programming, even in married households; some use the AI to offload emotional responsibilities, growing detached from their less and less significant other, but other couples accept the AI into a new kind of familial dynamic.\\n\\n## IDOL WORSHIPER\\nIn Tokyo, being a master entertainer is not enough. To truly compete on the Megacity stage, a person must be a singer-dancer-musician-model-actor hybrid: an idol. They are the total package and they inspire absolute fealty and obsession from their fans, who come from all parts of society. Most idols are rarely seen beyond their VR performances, constantly guarded by entire teams of corporate security forces or simply because they only exist in VR, written by talented avatar designers who are nothing like them. Their fans, however, are everywhere, sporting branded merch and performing their trademarked dance moves with precision, all day, every day. At any given idol event, mobs of their worshiping fans gather online and strain a Domain’s capacity. In a physical event, the mob swells onto the streets and threaten the peace. The most fanatic fans attach their emotional lives to those of the idol. A single rumor about the idol’s love life, if it goes public before PR manages to control the narrative, can halt production on entire product lines or cause chaos in the streets.\\n\\n## MASCOT ROBOT\\nMost train stations in Tokyo have their own mascot, usually taking the form of a saccharine lifesize cartoon character of some kind. These big-eyed caricatures are often associated with a local industry or known kami traditionally associated with the area. Though these mascots were originally embodied as plump costumes worn by humans, these days most are entirely robotic or VR constructs. These community directed robots have become akin to civil servants in many places, accepting complaints and presenting guidance. Recently they have begun to merge with the spirits they are meant to express, at times becoming entirely inhabited by the resident kami as though they were shires. Despite having been carefully programmed, such kami-inhabited robots are now monitored by their municipal creators as they tend to have strange outbursts or even displays of magical power.\\n\\n## NEIGHBORHOOD MYSTIC\\nSmall shrines and temples dot the cityscape of Tokyo, allowing residents to casually and reverently interact with the kami on a recurring basis throughout their day. Some see this as an old and useless tradition, others do it out of ritualistic habit, but a rare few take the kami seriously, maintaining their sacred spaces and serving as keepers of spiritual wisdom. Every neighborhood seems to have a wise man or woman whom the community turns to when matters involving the kami arise. Not exactly religious\\n', content_length=5139, page=29), Page(content='### ONLINE OTAKU\\n\\nFor some, being immersed in culture is more than just a creed, it\\'s the proper way to live. Japanese otaku are people so obsessed with some major aspect of popular or nerd culture that they have forsaken the physical world, happy to immerse themselves in a life that is always online – that\\'s where culture exists, after all. The most otaku of otaku fully engage with their online worlds, roleplaying constantly in virtual realities and games constructed by the media corporations. Many house themselves in pod apartments, just as the coffin workers do; however, in comparison to coffin workers, they treat their bodies well. “Meat maintenance” is a popular topic among them, and as many are independently wealthy, there are whole markets aimed at them, with devices and additives that the coffin workers only have on their wishlists. Some otaku are AR-junkies, who bring the virtual into the real. They modify their bodies to become their heroes through plastic sculpting and cybernetics, add holographic special effects, and configure their AR to present them with a world fitting of their hero – living their life 24/7.\\n\\n### OVERWORKED OFFICE WORKER\\n\\nThe typical office worker, or \"salaryman\" as they are often called, must commute to work in a corporate headquarters or nanex building at the whim of their middle-management overlords. Though most of their daily duties could be done in cyberspace, Tokyo managers require meatspace meetings as yet another proof of loyalty from their servants. The office is therefore a place to prove one\\'s worth as a person. These drone-like workers all dress alike, in order to keep from standing out from the crowd, and most are either completely sleep deprived or still hungover from last night. Being prevented from achieving a state of rested healthiness is a feature of the system, not a bug – the corp masters would rather have obedience over an ability to innovate or address challenges. Outside of work, they are either on their bikes, standing in a train, or buying something from a vending machine, almost always dreary eyed and browsing between entertainment streams.', content_length=2135, page=30), Page(content='# DISTRICTS OF TOKYO 20XX\\n\\n## FIVE RINGS MILITARY ZONES\\n**Military Base**\\n\\nThe Five Rings Paramilitary Company is an international armed force to be reckoned with, despite having relatively limited (they would say, \"selective\") manpower. Their fortress-districts, fencing off entire neighborhoods, stand at the edge of the Megacity, strategically placed near major ports since many of their missions take place abroad. The fortresses are equal parts awe-inspiring and terrifying, with ornate filigree and images of valiant soldiers carved on their impregnable walls. Troops and their families are housed in blocky residential apartment complexes, which serve as both barracks and family homes. This increases unit cohesion as does the fact that members of a unit are assigned to a specific apartment complex. Their most famous zone is the Inazumachō Detention Sector, a whole town that was converted into the ultimate for-profit prison, where lawbreakers and innocents who\\'ve made enemies of the megacorps are incarcerated. Flocks of Uguisi (bush warbler) drones patrol this district, communicating with each other using an unhackable network of high-pitched tones, much like their namesake bird.\\n\\n## ASSEMBLY LINES\\n**Run by Machines**\\n\\nDedicated to the production of consumer goods, an Assembly Line is more of a giant machine than a district. Rows of factories manufacture countless varieties of parts, circuitry, and devices. The majority of the process is automated, and the district is mostly populated with machines – androids, cargo drones, maintenance crawlers, and others. The Nearscape environment feels strangely alien, with countless artificial minds speaking among themselves. The few apartments here are owned by corporations, with the residents being engineers who live as little human interaction as possible, or managers who were banished here from a more comfortable position for some transgression. Those hiding from the law gather in the district\\'s abandoned warehouses, whether for shady criminal dealings, anti-corporate punk concerts, or meetings of android revolutionaries with corporate-indentured human co-conspirators.', content_length=2145, page=31), Page(content='# HOKKYO KUSEI GATED COMMUNITIES\\n## A Carefully Cultivated Environment\\n\\nEvery wage slave and mere dreamers of owning a manor in a Hokkyo Kusei Gated Community, gated villages promising a life of comfort, a far cry from the Megacity’s filthy streets. An android security force ensures that the rabble of Tokyo will never see a glimpse of the majesty behind the walls, and a small army of maintenance drones keeps the utilities in working order. These opulent districts, which have been popping up across the Megacity, are designed by genius architect Katsushika Hanako. She creates the gleaming palaces for Tokyo’s elite, each a masterpiece blending traditional Japanese architecture with a sleek modern style. Hanako claims her father’s spirit inspires her to create the designs; the Source-user community still hasn’t verified if this is indeed the case. The four largest Hokkyo Kusei communities are designed after the seasons, complete with biomes of serene gardens, parks, and zoos. The Bureau of Omnyō is specifically forbidden from reviewing these places, which makes it very suspicious.\\n\\n# HŌSEKI ROW\\n## A Night of Bizarre Pleasures\\n\\nWhen the sun sets in Tokyo, Hōseki Row awakens. There’s only one “real” Hōseki Row, but its dozens of imitators are doing such a good job that probably only history buffs care about the original. The ultimate nightlife center, it is filled with hostess clubs, izakaya (page 36), karaoke bars, love hotels, and pachinko parlors (page 37). The AR overlays can be blinding, but if one feels lost, any of the countless shapely androids greeters would be happy to escort you into the nearest attraction. Legal and illegal drugs are commonplace, and it doesn’t take much effort to find a supplier for stolen uploaded memories of famous idols or time-limited access keys to pleasure cyberspace Domains. Yakuza clans rule the district, maintaining an uneasy truce with the corps, whose offices are usually just on the other side of the street.', content_length=1976, page=32), Page(content='# MT. HŌRAI MEDIA CENTER  \\n## Super Hype!  \\nMt. Hōrai is a pop culture paradise, both in meatspace and in cyberspace. A vast complex of streets and towering buildings, its levels are crowded with arcades, electronic stores, merchandise shops, character cafes, and the tens of thousands of visitors that squat in them. Holographic advertisements cover towering skyscrapers, displaying the latest anime, amusement cyberworlds, virtual celebrities, and AR full of attention-grabbing memes. This is the place to go for tourists visiting from abroad, and it features life-size imitations of various Japanese landmarks so that no visitor will have a reason to go anywhere else. On its many platforms, idols perform their virtual concerts while Noh theaters cater to the more sophisticated; in cyberspace, it\\'s a central hub for wacky game shows and sponsored reality streams.  \\n\\n# OLD TOKYO  \\n## Rediscovered Grace  \\nAs Tokyo annexed and sprawled westward across the island, its centers of government and business moved to reside in a number of different sectors. What was once Old Tokyo\\'s urban spaces have become a dilapidated clutch of neighborhoods largely abandoned by the powers that be, though it still holds great interest to certain groups who know what secrets remain within the lawless slum. Chief among these are the Neo-Samurai, who have seized the Kōkyō, the old Imperial Palace, as their new headquarters in order to bolster their credibility and standing. The corps and the Neo-Samurai battle daily within the once busy streets of Old Tokyo, searching for relics and spiritual centers of the past to harvest their Sources, hoping to find an edge against one another in the growing mystical arms race.  \\n\\n# RYŌGEN UNIVERSITY CAMPUS  \\n## Worker Assembly Line  \\nTokyo\\'s most prestigious technical schools and high tech factories have migrated and merged over the last few decades to become a sprawling interconnected higher-education district that streamlines the journey from training to tech worker. Because so much of the education experience is conducted in cyberspace, the physical space is primarily dedicated to dormitories, VR lounges, harnessing stations, offices, workshops, and design complexes. Students can be found congregating in the voluminous cafeterias on campus, or in its beautiful gardens. Strangely, the campus has over the years formed into the shape of a zen rock garden pattern, mystically charging the zone with a surreal, almost creepy calm. It\\'s unclear if anyone is responsible, but the effects can be felt by outsiders, who are often shocked by the placid, mindless demeanor of the young residents here. With a curriculum decided by a megacorp-lobbied committee, and teachers recruited from those same megacorps, Ryōgen is built around job applicability. This is not a university experience of free thought and open minds, but an assembly line where workers are made.  \\n\\n# TENRYŪ-JŌ ISLE  \\n## Old-fashioned and Obtuse  \\nIf it could be said there’s a single seat of power for the Megacity\\'s government, it’s Tenryū-jō Isle. This gigantic administrative district is built on a reclaimed island in Biwa Lake near the geographical center of Tokyo, some distance from most cultural and commercial centers. There’s an \"old world\" atmosphere on Tenryū-jō, and even the many corporate bigwigs who frequently visit to make deals with the countless bureaucrats take care to dress appropriately. It is an open secret among those in the know that many kami have taken residence here, masquerading as bureaucrats, or haunting the Relics that clutter the place as museum displays or orbs of memory. Of these, the kami spirit of the Bureau of Onmyō, which maintains a presence here in a traditionally-designed building, is generally not allowed to interfere in the business of big government.  \\n\\n# KAMI ISLANDS  \\n## Place of Power  \\nScattered throughout Tokyo are dozens of Thin Places that serve as gateways into magical shima (islands) entirely ruled over by the kami. Some of these mystical islands show up in Japanese mythology as paradises or places where the rules of reality are strange. Each is associated with a particular kind of kami and most are ruled over by a single powerful spirit. Such island courts could be heavenly planes, earthly mountaintops, watery ponds, or hellish shadow realms; some shima even exist within cyberspace and are inhabited by the kami spirits of digital concepts and memes. Some kami come and go from these islands on a regular basis, and tend to consider this shima as a private retreat for their kind, but humans can cross over as well. Gateways into these spiritual realms often look like mundane doorways or arches, though some are carefully crafted torii gates which must be activated through prayer to open.  ', content_length=4777, page=33), Page(content='# MEIDO\\n## Ravaged Ruins\\n\\nTaking the name of the lands of the dead, the Meido (\"dark land\") is not a single region, but a general name for all the valleys that form the southern outskirts of the Tokyo Megacity. Here the mountains tower over abandoned outlands, landfills of trash, and dozens of isolated communities, from scavenger enclaves to scientific research centers. In the wake of the Nanotech Disaster, only the desperate, ignorant, or foolhardy call these valleys home. Several yōkai have merged with the industrial and urban waste, becoming monstrous beings, such as the Yakubyō Gami, a collection of pestilence spirits that have strangely become this land’s version of lawbringers. Groups of their devoted cultists, the Roamers (page 236), travel the Meido and seek out those who have transgressed against the laws of both society and the kami, inflicting them with diseases if the Yakubyō Gami judged them to be deserving of punishment.\\n\\n# YAKUSHI MEDICAL CORRIDOR\\n## Bio-war\\n\\nOriginally constructed by the Yakushi Medical Conglomerate, the Yakushi Medical Corridor cuts a path across the Megacity. Built around a major urban hospital complex, the corridor contains dozens of interconnected facilities, each specializing in different kinds of care or research. The quick access to shared medical resources and minds has lured most of the advanced biological and pharmaceutical labs in the Megacity to converge here, including even bitter rivals. As such, this region, while dedicated to health, has also become a deadly corporate warzone. With access to the most advanced medtech in the Megacity, face-changer biopods and multi-jointed infiltrators see common use, while straightforward violence is also astonishingly common, since life is cheap: soldiers wounded in the fighting are often quickly revived, with new cybernetic parts to show for their courage. Thus the warfare never ends, as more fighters are recycled and put back out on the streets for more fighting and testing of experimental biotech mods and resurrection procedures.\\n\\n# ZAIBATSU BLOCK\\n## Conform, or Else\\n\\nDozens of skyscrapers pierce the sky of a Zaibatsu Block, a megacorporate center where a hundred companies share office blocks, company headquarters, and conference centers. Most, but not all commercial entities in a Block belong to the same zaibatsu, and while the untrained (and Noise-filled) mind will see that this fast food chain is more prominent here and not there, and this town uses only WhiteWhite maintenance drones while that one uses only AntiBacs. Most workers in Tokyo are loyal employees of their corporations, but they don\\'t always know it, developing a preference for specific logos. An army of workers spend their days in these offices, then go seek respite in ramen shops or izakaya (page 36) with their coworkers. Those with families return to the suburbs, while bachelors live in village-sized apartment buildings, with rooms that barely fit a single person.', content_length=2970, page=34), Page(content='# TOKYO 20XX SCENE LOCATIONS\\n\\n## BIKE PARKADE\\n\\nMultistory automobile parking complexes are a staple of cyberpunk, but they’re less common in Tokyo due to the Megacity’s penchant for bikes and trains. Instead, massive train-station adjacent bike parkades serve a similar purpose as a place to park and as a semi-enclosed shady spot to hold showdowns and handoffs. Automation is rife and there’s a cam in every corner and a vending machine next to every thick column, but security is joke and easily hacked. When a fight goes down, the bikes are often the first victims, scraped across concrete and melting under the heat of magical effects, leaving the parkade’s friendly AR mascot, who was supposed to help you find your parking space, quite confused.\\n\\n## CANAL WATERWAY\\n\\nTokyo was once a city in harmony with nature, built as a nexus of rivers, relying on its waterways for trade and transport. Over the centuries the city destroyed this balance, polluting and paving over its rivers and streams. Still, the water had to go somewhere and so as the Megacity expanded from coast to coast it shunted rivers into straight canals. These industrial-looking waterways were neglected as well, becoming cesspools of filth and disease which occasionally overflow and flood their surroundings. Criminal groups know that operating in and on the canals makes them essentially invisible to the rest of the Megacity, which pretends that the old rivers no longer exist.\\n\\nThe canals suffer from spiritual pollution as well. The old rivers once served as important reservoirs for magical energy, and the unclean nature of the newer waterways, as well as the population’s disregard for them, pollutes the energy in the districts through which they flow. The Bureau of Omnyō is trying to appeal through proper channels to rectify the shape of the canals, since this taint affects the dragons who live there and creates new yōkai threats, but no progress is being made.\\n\\n## 24 HOUR CORPORATE OFFICE\\n\\nWith zaibatsu companies engaging in the kind of espionage that was once only the purview of nations, the corporate home office serves as a tempting target for mercs – but “after hours” is a thing of the past. In the Tokyo Megacity, the most dedicated salarymen are encouraged to stay for\\n', content_length=2268, page=35), Page(content='entire midnight shifts. At every hour of the day, a considerable number of obsessed and loyal workers, often hyped up on caffeine and brainwave inducers, can be found lurking or huddled at their desks in the open plan offices. On occasion, a poor soul will literally work themselves to death, a common-enough phenomenon that has a name, karōshi (\"overwork death\"). This is to the merc\\'s advantage, however, as the discovery of the body of a worker in their booth might not bring about the amount of attention one would think it should.\\n\\n# CROWDED TRAIN STATION\\n\\nTokyo is a network of towns, each centered on a train station. Where other Megacities rely on a complicated system of motorways, Tokyo\\'s lifeblood is a system of complicated train routes. With many organizations mandating late night work hours or early morning shifts, commuters are a common sight at all hours, and the stations are always busy. Some workers sleep at the stations, in the adjacent capsule motels.\\n\\nThe trains are managed by several complex AI systems, which supposedly follow the schedules to the second, but maintenance failures are not uncommon – unless you’re taking a luxurious train. On the regular lines, the millions of commuters are packed like sardines, each only paying attention to their own AR interface. Some criminal elements, particularly teenage gang members, essentially run the trains themselves with certain routes gaining a reputation for quick drug trade, easy smuggling, or as places to acquire basic hacking services. The train stations themselves have little use for professional mercs, as the surveillance level tends to be high, but they’re an excellent place to lose a pursuer.\\n\\n# IZAKAYA\\n\\nThe izakaya (sake clubs) are alcohol bars where afterwork revelry takes place. This institution has existed for as long as Japan has been a nation, and the clubs are sometimes called akachōchin (\"red lanterns\") for the paper lanterns that traditionally adorn them. Corporate white collar workers are expected to go out to these clubs once their shift is over, to drink, socialize, and sing karaoke with their fellow floormates. This drinking tradition is called \"nomikai\", and the social pressure to participate has the effect of completely depriving many office workers of a home life unless they are willing to sacrifice their employment futures by neglecting these de-facto extra work hours, and so these places are usually surrounded by service providers catering to lonely, drunk wage slaves.\\n\\n# KŌBAN\\n\\nKōban (\"police box\") are small isolated police outposts, about the size of a convenience store. Most Tokyo prefectures can’t allocate many resources to fighting crime in each and every neighborhood, so they resort to placing these tiny stations along main junctions, each fielding about a dozen cops. Kōban-assigned police officers are often only given access to bicycles and camera drones to aid them in law enforcement, and more often than not, their familiarity with the goings on in the surrounding streets is limited by how unwelcoming they tend to be towards the police. Kōban are often the target of intense gang graffiti campaigns and constant pranking. Still, if a local wanted to talk to the police in person, this is where they would go.\\n\\n# KONBINI\\n\\nAround most corners in the Megacity there’s a small convenience store. These konbini, though often run by some international corporation and sporting the same logos you would see worldwide, serve a fundamental purpose in the life of Tokyo\\'s residents. Not only are their shelves stuffed with plastic-wrapped snacks and drinks, but also with other life necessities such as bento box meals and email stations and VR headset loans. Most offer an array of bureaucratic services too, so you can pay your fines and send your snail mail from the same counter. A well-stocked konbini, with a proper staff, can serve as a powerful center of neighborhood life.\\n\\n# MATSURI\\n\\nA matsuri (\"festival\" or \"holiday\") is a kind of Japanese festival, usually to celebrate a local spirit or spiritual event. Each shrine has its own festival, usually in the summer, during which the mikoshi (portable shrine) is paraded around the neighborhood along with dancing, festivities, and merchant and food stands. In much of the Megacity, the original meaning of the festivals is lost, as many shrines have fallen out of use or their teachings have been oversimplified through the Noise. At such matsuri events, aesthetics take the stage: people show up to show off their outlandish Decora fashion – a vivid, over-the-top style of complicated cosplay, or excessive cybernetics such as chromed skin. A staple of matsuri is fireworks, both in the air and, as well as celebrating the town\\'s local cuisine. Kami find these festivities irresistible, not only joining in, but easily blending in, trying out the foods, posing as \"weird mascots\" in selfies for the festival goers, and in the process seeming to eat up all of this attention.\\n', content_length=4969, page=36), Page(content=\"## SENTŌ\\n\\nThe communal bath houses have returned to prominence in the Tokyo Megacity as a means of maintaining hygiene, socializing with one's peers, and enjoying a rare moment of relaxation. The modern sentō experience is blended with other forms of entertainment, such as bars, nightclubs, or brothels. Some are run by local gangs, giving themselves a hangout where visitors must come in visibly unarmed. Some sentō double as cyberspace parlors, complete with harnesses. This allows patrons the opportunity to float comfortably in the soothing warm water of the baths as they jack into the net. Hacking groups will sometimes even rent out a sentō for the night in order to gain exclusive access to the pools, believing the floating grants them an advantage.\\n\\n## SHŌTENGAI\\n\\nShōtengai are pedestrian-only streets dedicated to shops and shopping, closed to vehicle traffic and often covered to protect against rain, acidic or otherwise. In a sense they are like tiny suburban malls, with central management and security services. In some parts of the Megacity, shōtengai are central to the culture of the area, hosting festivals and parades. The streets were once roads leading to shrines, but while the streets remained, the temples have long since been demolished. These older shopping districts are still haunted by the spirits that once dwelled there, now causing no small amount of grief to residents who are not aware that the old kami resent the lack of reverence shown to them. They enjoy joining the festivals, though!\\n\\n## NOODLE SHOP\\n\\nRamen shops are a common sight on Tokyo's streets, usually as either tiny indoor restaurants or sit-down street carts. Everyone has their favorite, the place that makes the noodles just right, or where the chef lets them have an extra gyoza. These little eateries are a staple of life in the Megacity, particularly in the impoverished neighborhoods, which are shunned by the big food chains. Sitting side by side and slurping noodles is an easy way to avoid catching the eye of a fellow diner, allowing tense conversations to benefit from the noodle shop's casual atmosphere. When a customer looks another dead in the eye, everyone knows that something serious is about to happen and such places have long been used for meetings between rivals, or to settle grudges.\\n\\n## PACHINKO PARLOR\\n\\nPachinko is a Japanese pastime played as a means of gambling. It involves placing steel balls into a device that looks like a cross between a pinball machine and a slot machine, which can be redeemed for currency. Pachinko parlors have been operating in a legal gray area for many years, as gambling for money is illegal in Japan. The Yakuza and others are able to provide other gambling options, but they gear mostly toward the rich. The common people love their pachinko.\\n\\nPachinko parlors are incredibly noisy and very chaotic, both in meatspace and AR, making it almost impossible to be eavesdropped upon. They are frequented by luck kami and yōkai that prey upon the misfortune of gamblers. Many of these yōkai were once gamblers themselves, now haunting the parlors that took their livelihoods from them.\\n\\n## RYŌKAN\\n\\nThe ryōkan are traditionally-styled Japanese inns, harkening back to a much older age. Usually a staple of rural tourist areas, these hotels are becoming more prevalent in the Megacity proper, offering a luxury retreat for professionals who want to get out of town (but still remain in Tokyo) or act as a convention center. Most ryōkan hotels can offer a Japanese tea service, providing a formal meeting place surrounded by trappings of elegance. Another staple in ryōkan are onsen, hot spring bathing facilities, meant for calm relaxation in a natural environment. Modern ryōkan often lack access to hot springs, and therefore provide different spa services.\", content_length=3814, page=37), Page(content='# GLOSSARY\\n\\n**Bōsōzoku** (page 28).

If you use this to have the Bureau violate or overlook its own Mythic regulations, you also become tagged-2 by the Bureau\\'s Internal Affairs division.\\n\\n- **Helpful Kami:** A helpful minor kami, such as a bake-da-nuki (mischievous tanuki yōkai) or kaibyō (\"strange cat\"), has taken a fascination with your mundane aspects. Once a session, when you take action without invoking Mythic or Noise tags, you may treat a miss (6-) as a mixed hit (7-9), or a mixed hit (7-9) as a strong hit (10+), as they help you in your endeavor.\\n\\n- **Game Fame:** You\\'ve become famous thanks to one of Tokyo\\'s fastest-growing sports: AR gaming.

Once per session, when facing yōkai, you may gain vengeful at any tier up to 3. Just before this status expires (usually at the end of the scene or when you collide, whichever comes first), you take tainted-2, with vengeful hindering your mitigation.\\n\\n- **Nanotech Residue:** You have been attacked and infected by nanotech, which regards your bloodstream as its territory and protects it ferociously.

Whenever you roll when attempting to influence a kami, ask them to bless or curse someone, or tend to their shrine or Thin Place, on a 10+, you may achieve a great success (and spend 1 additional Power, if the outcome is tracked) without generating Consequences.

Once per session, when you receive the spotlight, you may gain or give this status to someone in the scene, then act as normal.\\n\\n- **Synthetic Liaison:** You have one of the latest models of personal robot assistants, often acquired by Tokyo’s elite. At the end of every downtime, you may choose one person in Tokyo to whom your assistant has been making calls or visits on your behalf; you then gain good-favor-2 with that person until the next downtime. The MC may overrule this with specific NPCs if they are unavailable or particularly averse to being contacted by your PC or assistant.\\n\\n- **Tsukumogami:** A piece of equipment you own or found has become significant enough to awaken with its own kami or spirit. Choose a power tag representing it; it becomes an autonomous Mythic being capable of acting on its own (secondary character) and you may converse with it and ask it questions about its field of expertise (e.g., construction for a hammer) and about the world of kami and yōkai (the Otherscape). Once per session, you may take action with this tsukumogami tag as an interjection (without receiving the spotlight).\\n\\n- **Zen Against the Noise:** You have studied traditional Zen meditation techniques that help you stay focused in the most distracting situations. Once per scene, when you have a few moments to meditate, you may gain 2 Power which you may spend to give yourself centered-2 or otherwise counteract any Effect of confusion, overwhelming, or overload that is the result of the Noise or any tech that spreads it.

Many Challenges are a blend of old and new, Mythos and Noise.\\n\\nThough encounters with kami can be purely spiritual in nature, with the spirit never making its presence perceptible, many kami have changed with the times and now influence future tech, social movements, and places.

This means that cyberspace has kami, as do science laboratories, idol shows, and trash heaps. It usually takes considerable effort or time (about 100 years or so) for an item to become awakened, but once that happens, even a person's cyberware can be corrupted or turned against its owner.

A trickster spirit that once sold trinkets at the roadside might now become the clerk at a 24 hour konbin store. The trappings change, but the role remains.\\n\\nMost yōkai are essentially ghost stories and horror tales that come alive within this dark cyberpunk Tokyo. Some were once humans, corrupted by their own anger or a spiritual taint. Others were once benevolent kami whose domain became toxic, or came to feel slighted or forlorn. Many are simply malevolent, vicious, or hateful by nature.\\n\\nMost yōkai can be banished with the use of Mythic warding magic. Such Esoterica is most commonly available in the Megacity through Shinto and Buddhist prayers or ofuda talismans. Some can potentially even be banished with sheer willpower and emotional strength, but at least one of the yōkai’s weaknesses must be exploited for this to happen. See also Banishing a Conjuration in the supplement :Otherscape Action Database.\\n\\nWhen a yōkai is banished, one of three things might happen. The weaker ones might disappear, disintegrating into wisps of nothingness. Evil spirits that inhabit natural entities, such as a Jubboko, might instead be exorcized, the corrupt presence removed, leaving behind a healthy individual. The most powerful yōkai might not be truly destroyed by banishment, and instead are forced to flee or hide and make themselves scarce from the scene and perhaps the entire location. These evils must be handled in a more robust way, perhaps with a sealing ritual to contain them.\\n\\nTo prepare for an encounter with a yōkai, mercs can obtain repelling talismans that impart a warded status and protect the bearer from otherworldly harm, and in addition perform a spiritual purification ritual (known as haare) that imparts that status purified, preventing yōkai from feeding off the merc’s misdeeds or negative feelings, or manipulating them.', content_length=2168, page=97), Page(content=\"# CYBERSPACE YŌKAI\\n\\n## RAKUGO VIRUS\\n\\nThe Rakugoka Virus is a recent menace in the Tokyo Tangle, lurking inside innocent-looking virtual objects.

What they want is unclear; the extent of their magic is even less so. More than anything, they seem to enjoy toying with the lives and fortunes of mortals, whom they see as pawns and little else.\\n\\nIn the Megacity, the yamanba have taken to the tops of the tallest skyscrapers, practicing their crafts both new and old. The witches have embraced modern technologies, using holograms and invasive AR alongside ancient spells, to befuddle and manipulate the poor maintenance workers and occasional mercs who find themselves on a building's roof. The dwellings of the yamanba are twisted, wondrous landscapes, a blend of popular media and forgotten myth, reaching even into cyberspace, although only a rare few get to witness these places and leave unharmed.\\n\\nEngaging in conversation with a yamanba requires catching her attention, usually with humorous tongue-twisters or radical theories about the latest drama series she’s hooked on. Once she marks someone interesting it’s hard to make her relent, and that person might end up as either very fortunate or wishing for their own death. It can be worth it, though – the yamanba have ways to meld cyberspace and the physical world, allowing themselves and others to travel into cyberspace in their own bodies, while manifesting cyberspace entities and even remnants as if they were real physical beings.\\n\\nWhile their abilities might be helpful, it is just as likely that any encounter with the witches will end in them binding your conscious mind into a new digital virus, which they then unleash on your friends just to see them squirm.\", content_length=3682, page=98), Page(content='## YAMAMBA\\n\\n**LIMITS**\\n\\n- HURT OR SUBDUED 4\\n- IMPRESS 4\\n- BANISH 4\\n\\n**TAGS & STATUSES**\\n\\n- digital magic, home field advantage, weird-2, foul-mood-3\\n\\n**SPECIALS**\\n\\n- **CURSED GROUND:** Bending reality with their magics, the Yamamba can use chaos as a weapon.

Otherwise, it’s said, you may encounter the ghostly visage of a beautiful long-haired woman dressed in a white kimono, who appears stepping out of the static snow of a visor or holo display. Every hacker knows a story about someone who claims to have encountered her in the liminal space of crashed moments between virtual and physical reality.\\n\\nYuki-onna (\"snow woman\") is usually seen carrying a bundle and asking for help carrying it. Helping her, or even getting anywhere near her, leads to a growing chill that becomes more and more unbearable the friendlier she gets. The bundle looks like a wrapped-up baby, but inside the wrappings is just forms junk data that clings to one’s avatar and makes them so heavily encumbered they can’t move; the snow eventually covering them until they freeze and die. When a hacker is found frozen solid in their seat while still Harnessed, it is said to be because they were visited by Yuki-onna.\\n\\nYuki-onna prefers to approach isolated individuals. She appears before someone in the moments they disconnect from VR abruptly or are in dire fire, a milliseconds stretched to several minutes from the person\\'s perspective, during which no one else can come and help them. She enjoys watching people succumbing to the cold, or perhaps she is fascinated by how they slowly die as their body fails.\\n\\nThere is a soft side to her, however, and if told of an injustice or slight that was done to her victim – especially if children are involved – she might take offense in their name and offer her help in righting the wrong.

Many office buildings are home to small companies that no longer have any viability and perhaps never had, created by their zaibatsu for tax purposes or to manipulate the numbers. These companies do nothing but shift around some data, their employees working a literally meaningless job, which is nonetheless exhausting and time consuming. Most of these companies are also sinking ships, slowly losing whatever little support they had from their sister-corps, dragging their zombie-like workers along into the mire.\\n\\nWhen a staff member inevitably succumbs to exhaustion and dies, the powerful symbolic instance of such karoshi (“overwork death”) can raise their spirit as an onryō, a vengeful ghost, of a kind that shares many similarities with the ghosts of resentful drowned sailors, the funayūrei (“boat spirit”). These “office funayūrei”, like the spirits of the sailors, died as part of a crew who was drowning, with no hope and no help. Unlike the sailors, most of their crew is still alive, and the funayūrei wish to hasten their demise, to shipwreck the entire company.\\n\\nBecause these companies are small and irrelevant, there's little to stop the spirits from getting their wish. There's no one who cares enough to bring an onmyōji or call some mercs for an exorcism. Under the influence of the yōkai the company crashes, the bosses demand more overtime, and eventually the entire staff stops going home and work themselves to death, joining the ranks of the funayūrei.\\n\\nA funayūrei-haunted building is filled with wandering souls. The spirits of salespeople and secretaries drift through the bland, samey corridors in which they worked, passing by shades of callous bosses and unsympathetic coworkers. The people of the block forget this building is even here.\\n\\nThe crew might find themselves inside by chance during a chase, as a hiding place from their foes or baited inside by an escaping enemy. They might pick the bland building as an ideal place to establish a lookout or a sniper nest, overlooking a more important building in the zaibatsu block.

Before his body expired, Riku pulled a final prank and uploaded an approximation of his consciousness into Riyo\\'s assistive cybernetic suite – a set of surgically-precise extra arms attached at his waistline. With his new set of limbs and a projected holographic torso, Riku was back in the game, after a fashion. That naturally backfired; the cybernetic suite became the Source of the Dōmokō, a two-headed yōkai that were once surgeons who killed themselves trying to win a contest against each other. There was no removing it, or deleting the Riku code. In fact, simulated Riku only became more and more like his real self, essentially brought back from the dead. The bitter rivals have been stuck with each other ever since, constantly bickering, but they also became the best cybersurgeons in the field, capable of achieving far beyond what is possible with current technology.

There are many human entities in the Tokyo tale that are more magic than data, hiding behind skins and disguises that present a human-looking avatar.

Some kami have no special reason to remain anchored here or there, shifting between a corporeal form and a cyberspace form in the blink of an eye.\\n\\nA kami who is shown reverence or is otherwise convinced to grant aid (appease), can do so in the form of story tags, changing elements in its domain or revealing the path to something useful.

Relentless urban expansion ruined the temple complex hosting Tesso\\'s shrine, and the ancient spirit stirred in displeasure. It pushed through the Noise until it could find something to lodge itself into, and came to possess a truck-sized robotic hauler, one of the vehicles used to destroy the shrine. A horde of rats then appeared and took over the construction area, driving away all intruders and granting Tesso a little peace.\\n\\nInfused with metal and electricity, Tesso grew aware of cyberspace. Once it reached into Nearspace and the Tangle, the Iron Rat became mesmerized by the unending, interconnected, and disturbed mess - like a rat\\'s nest. Tesso manifested a horde of digital rat constructs which began to spread over the local network, sniffing around, while the meatspace rats that inhabited the construction site magically developed cybernetics in order to be networked as well. The horde began to pilfer new technologies from the shops and vehicles around, with Tesso slowly developing a greater understanding of cybernetics, constantly upgrading its army with more complex designs.\\n\\nTesso now wishes to increase its network connectivity, to create a home for itself in cyberspace, and to get the reverence it deserves from the people of the town. This scheme involves using its technological rats to erect communications towers that create a sub-layer in Nearspace, allowing Tesso and its constructs to spread, burrow, and steal while remaining \\'behind the walls and under the floors\\' of the Tangle, where no one would notice them. Eventually, Tesso wants the shrine grounds to be restored, but it hasn\\'t given much thought as to how to achieve that.\\n\\nTesso\\'s Source is the Thin Place at its ruined shrine. While it is inhabiting the Touched hauler mech that demolished the site (use a Scale 2 pilotless Mecha, page 127), it can also manifest as a Conjuration wherever enough rats gather in town. It usually appears as a metallic rat, around four feet tall, composed of junk metal sheets, servos, and electronics, as if assembled from a tech dump. It can also appear as a heavily-augmented human with a rat’s face, if it wishes to approach someone personally. It can\\'t speak nor does it fully understand people, but it knows enough to manipulate people against each other, which it is preferred way to dispose of any opposition. The rats listen and Tesso replays the juiciest bits to ear that shouldn\\'t be hearing them, creating discord that diverts attention from its works.\\n\\nThe Limits listed for Tesso are for one of its specific manifestations.

Looking into the eyes of the innocent dying deer, the CEO saw the error of his ways and couldn\\'t bear living a moment longer. He jumped out of the window, and as he rolled down the tilted side of the skyscraper he transformed into the Wandering Tank as punishment for his sins, and now patrols the streets in search of other sinners to punish. The second story tells of a vengeful corp executive who, in his hatred of the mercs who foiled a magnificent plan he devised, planted his consciousness into a prototype machine and went after them. Whichever the case may be, the Wandering Tank seems keen on chasing down mercs.\\n\\nThe Wandering Tank is an armored ball tank – a weapons platform balanced on top of a perfect sphere – about as tall as a human, and with a giant human face.

Perhaps due to appearing first in the cyberspace rumor mill, the yōkai is being shaped by what is being said about it. As this happens, its morals and purpose change, dragged along with it the political narrative that is currently in the news. The current tale evolved in such a way as to cast it as a semi-noble deliverer of justice for the masses.

The person most likely to join the Goblins is one who was fired from a corp or failed to achieve a desired position they believed they totally deserved. They are united through the feeling of being betrayed by what they once believed was the correct way of life.\\n\\nMusic takes a central place in the Bokuba subculture. The musical instruments the Goblins use are sources of bi-wa-bokubō, a kind of tsukumogami (page 19) created when a musical instrument is neglected by its owner. Left to their own devices, they animate during the night and move around their owner\\'s habitat, singing sad songs about their irrelevance.

The Source is an entire castle, its magic allowing it to be contained within a ritually-prepared metallic briefcase – when opened, it becomes an instant military outpost, a fully-armed forward base complete with barracks, vehicles, and weaponry, as well as a Security System (Metro:Otherscape, page 319).\\n\\nBeyond the obvious advantages, the sudden appearance of a fortified paramilitary presence deep within a gang territory or on a corporation\\'s doorstep could, by itself, be enough to break the enemy\\'s spirit. Once deployed, the Five Rings unit aims to quickly overwhelm the enemy and claim victory within a short amount of time; should that fail, however, the castle would be able to serve as a long-term base and even hold out against a siege until relieved.\\n\\nThe castle has a secret weakness, due to the nature of its Source. The real Sunomata Castle (which was constructed over several days) was mostly a façade of wooden walls and towers, with the sole purpose of confounding and demoralizing the enemy. It was unable to withstand any serious assault. Similarly, the One-night Castle has a wooden lynchpin, a single plank set against a wall inside one of its chambers, and that plank supports the entire Mythical weight of the structure.

Their true form is that of a fox with several tails, but since they are gifted shapeshifters and consummate liars, most people never suspect the person in front of them is a yōkai bent on ruining their life. In Tokyo, they act as charlatans, thieves, or spies, and their personalities come in many flavors. Some are malicious and cruel, others see themselves as capricious, happy-go-lucky jesters, or even as educators who teach the lesson of being careful with strangers. From the point of view of their victims, the results are the same — unwanted drama and personal loss.\\n\\nKitsune carry a magical focus in the form of a jewelry piece or a significant token which holds their power – their hoshi no tama (\"star ball\"). They steal the lifeforce of others, usually by touching them, and store it inside their hoshi no tama, growing stronger overtime. As they do, they become wiser, but also more dangerous and eccentric. Without their hoshi no tama, the kitsune cannot create fire, conjure illusions, or drain essence.\\n\\nWhen revealing their true forms as a fox, a kitsune will usually have between one to four tails, a show of their power and experience. As clever as they are, they never stop being foxes, a fact that can be exploited by people who are aware of their fondness for tofu and red beans.\\n\\n## ELDER KITSUNE\\n\\nAs they grow in power, a kitsune can gain more tails – and once they have at least five, they become worthy of the title \"elder\". No longer in need of a hoshi no tama and even more sophisticated and cunning than their younger kin, the elders are master deceivers and corruptors who usually hide in plain sight among the higher ups in Megacity’s social ladder. They manipulate powerful figures such as gang bosses and corporate bigwigs as either consorts or by possessing their loved ones.\\n\\nThe strongest of their kind are the kyūbi who have nine tails and are blessed with godlike wisdom that allows them to always remain one step ahead of the crew and discern their victim’s secrets and greatest desires to further boost their deception.\\n\\nElder Kitsune watch their targets for a long while before taking action, manipulating events to place them in situations that reveal their personality.

This is true for all personnel: front line fighters, drone pilots, support hackers, administrators, even maintenance workers, as they are all considered part of the Five Rings “coherent whole” philosophy. The rewards, at least, are substantial: excellent health and mental care, being surrounded by like-minded people, immensely rewarding experiences, and the prestige of being a part of one of the best International armed forces.\\n\\nFive Rings’ tactical approach takes inspiration from the famous **Book of the Five Rings** by Miyamoto Musashi, and its philosophy considers all elements of the mission as having equal importance: preparation, timing, improvisation, and maintaining one’s mindset throughout. The Company pays equal attention to cyber warfare, electronic warfare, and oevne warfare, and recently even Mythic warfare as its strategists began to read the world map and noticed there’s a lot of magic being thrown around. Never willing to ignore an advantage, Five Rings are now developing a strategy for Source-based combat support, slowly and methodically.\\n\\nEvery Five Rings Officer is equipped with an Uguisu drone (and a few backups), the Company’s favored communication device. Named after the Japanese bush warbler, known for its unique call, this fist-sized ultra-light drone flies on rapidly-moving wings to find high positions from which it can be heard most clearly.

The programs patrol their Domains, dressed in traditional monk's garb such as a many-layered kimono, engaging in discussion with would-be hackers via rapid-fire digital queries. They carefully study each answer – and digital markers – and employ top-tier heuristic functions to identify risks to the system to tell friend from foe and human from AI. If a threat is detected, they deploy their famous proprietary Naginata 2DHR or Third Eye TX subroutines, which kill unauthorized code running on their Domain or trace it back to its source, respectively. The Naginata 2L8 variant, an expensive firewall with zealous cybersecurity, can also scar a human hacker's neural paths in a way that prevents them future use of VR or harnessing.\\n\\nOn occasion, a Sōhei IC does the unthinkable and goes on a pilgrimage – escaping its Domain to travel through the Tangle and explore the Spirals on a voyage toward some mysterious destination. Tendai Corporation, the publisher, insists these are not rogue AIs, but that this behavior is an intended thread database update process. Human seekers who encounter such programs find them shockingly realistic and often come away believing that perhaps the AI has achieved enough enlightenment to become the reincarnation of some saint or bodhisattvas.\\n\\nBesides its occasional cyberquest, there is no hard evidence to point at the software being Touched by a Source.

We are now in an age of nightmares, when monsters dare stalk the streets in broad daylight, ghosts infiltrate our sacred institutions. We are the only ones who understand the yōkai, the only ones with the legal right to deal with them. Harmony and balance must be maintained.”  \\n— Chief Inspector Ishikawa Rin\\n\\nCenturies ago the fledgling Japanese empire created a bureaucratic agency based on mystical Chinese teachings of balance, flow, and natural change. The purpose of this Bureau of Onmyō was to provide answers to supernatural questions posed by Japan's rulers. The members of the Bureau, called onmyōdō, became practitioners of the Esoteric knowledge of Yin and Yang, blessed by the Mythos of Onmyōdō, an early Japanese system of natural science which evolved from metaphysical concepts of Chinese origin.\\n\\nThey learned to use prophecy at scales large and small, to predict the future and maintain the calendar. They came to focus their power through a single sacred shrine, which would later be removed and rebuilt where the capital of the empire changed, flowing along with the center of power.\\n\\nThrough careful study and experimentation, these supernaturally trained clerks and political appointees learned to summon their own personal kami, the shikigami. As their mastery over spirits increased, they were tasked with tracking the yōkai and other strange forces which threatened the empire. They turned their magics and shikigami against...\", content_length=1725, page=151), Page(content='these creatures, cleansing the land. Soon they broadened their purview even further and began to police all forms of supernatural activity, going where Shinto priests could not, for fear of losing their religious purity.\\n\\nBut they did their job too well. By the time the Industrial Revolution came along, the Bureau\\'s services were no longer needed. The yōkai were nowhere to be found, and more efficient, less ritualistic methods of prediction came to replace the laborious ways of the onmyōji. The Bureau lost so much of its power, it almost shut its doors for good. Funding was severely slashed, branches shut, staff numbers radically reduced, training drastically curtailed, and influence dangerously lost, yet the remaining onmyōji retained the knowledge the bureau had acquired over centuries of policing strange spirits. They kept the flame burning, predicting a day when the yōkai would return in strength.\\n\\nFor the last few decades the Bureau has gathered its resources and trained a new generation of onmyōji inspectors. The rise of the Noise has made it almost impossible to convince government officials outside of the Bureau to accept its worth, to say nothing of increasing its budget, and therefore leaders within the Bureau started using their spiritual servants to gather blackmail on the Megacity’s dimming power, pulling strings to secure funding. While many see the Bureau as a laughably superstitious government agency, the Bureau’s agents see themselves as fighters on the frontline of a war they’re steadily losing, willing to go further and further, and justifying their acts by constantly widening the definition of ‘corruption’.\\n\\nThe onmyōji justify their questionable activities by claiming they help keep the world in balance, in the name of Yin and Yang and the betterment of the Megacity. Yet as the Bureau’s influence grows, its agents grow bolder and stray further. They seek to destroy corruption in both the spiritual and mundane senses, and yet more and more of the men succumb to both, using whatever means they please to avert demonic yōkai forces in their role as Source regulators and protectors of the Megacity. Some bind yōkai to their service, while others serve such creatures in return for powerful magics they see as necessary tools in their arsenals.\\n\\n# POWER CORRUPTS\\n\\nAfter years of being shunned by the government, the Bureau of Onmyō is used to handling its own business. Through blackmail and careful political manipulations it has managed to gain official authority over all supernatural activity in Tokyo, granting it access and enforcement powers throughout the Megacity, even among high circles.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## THE BUREAU AT A GLANCE\\n\\n- **Agenda**: Root out \"corruption\", which means yōkai influence of any sort, through mystical and technological. \\n\\n- **MO**: Bureaucratic authority, acting on ancient knowledge of the kami, prophetic predictions, funding through blackmail.\\n\\n- **Tech**: Cybernetics and drones enhanced with ki flow sensors, allowing for real time feng shui assessments and supernatural tracking.\\n\\n- **Sources**: Esoteric knowledge gained through the Mythos of Onmyōdō. Inspectors are armed with one-use spells written on magically inscribed ofuda (paper talismans) and their personal shikigami kami. \\n\\n- **Frontliners**: Detectives, known as onmyōji, investigating supernatural corruption.\\n\\n- **Stronghold**: The Temple of Onmyōdō, a place rebuilt each time the capital of Japan, where the Bureau’s leaders meet and important ceremonies are conducted.\\n\\n- **Motifs**: Trench coats and sunglasses. Yin-Yang symbolism binds bootlegged spells with the powers of those cast from burning ofuda papers.\\n\\nThe Bureau\\'s financing department and higher management have perfected several magical blackmailing techniques, using scrying, dream walking, and fortune manipulation to obtain personal information or force their targets to act in a despicable manner, which they then capture on camera. These techniques, as well as the blackmail materials themselves, are passed personally between those in the know, to reduce the chance of anyone else learning of them, whether from within the Bureau or outside it.\\n\\nThe inspectors of the Bureau stalk the streets, going wherever they please, appearing unannounced. They have the authority to execute those they suspect of being corrupted, but considering the Bureau is the agency which decides how to define and measure corruption, there’s some real danger of power running amok here. And indeed, while in the past the inspectors would only attack people who were possessed and corrupted by the supernatural, these days, almost any sort of influence can mark one as being corrupt, depending on the onmyōji doing the questioning.\\n\\n---\\n\\nProperty of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284', content_length=4802, page=152), Page(content='Two things reign back this power. First, the Bureau’s ongoing manpower crisis means most onmyōji work alone, and one must have quite the gall to stand before an entire gang of oni motorcycles and just start shooting. Second, and at least for now, most onmyōji are people of principle. Still subscribing to old recruitment processes, the Bureau is very selective when picking initiates, as it deems only a rare few worthy of being Japan’s magical judges and keepers of the ancient secrets.\\n\\nOnmyōji usually travel in their own cars, with their shikigami at their side. They are armed with police-grade guns and blessed ammo, but usually defer to their magical training with which they can manipulate energies, move things from afar, and create protective wards.\\n\\n## BALANCED STRUCTURE\\n\\nThe Bureau is a tiered structure, led by a master of Onmyōdō who bears the title of Kami, with each tier wielding petty bureaucratic power over those below them in the chain of command. Below the Kami is a tier of deputies and secretaries, who run much of the bureau’s spying and blackmail operations. Beneath these bureaucrats are the onmyōji, the on-the-scene inspectors who patrol the Megacity in search of the supernatural taint of yokai.\\n\\nAll onmyōji are well-versed in arcane teachings and Megacity laws, but not all of them wield Esoteric Yin and Yang magic. An onmyōji’s initiation includes a visit to the Temple of Onmyōdō where they are exposed to the Source, but a few do not gain the required enlightenment. They must carry this shame and rely on more mundane methods in their onmyōji duties.\\n\\nNearly every onmyōji inspector has her own personal shikigami as a servant and sidekick that exists within both the real world and cyberspace simultaneously. In ages past, the Bureau used to sell the services of their shikigami to “curse” ones enemies, for a hefty fee. Today, these spirits, which look like a ghostly child or ethereal animal, are deployed as spies, occult assistants, and even assassins. The bond between the onmyōji and her spirit is complex, as the spirits are not always willing partners and must be reigned in with binding spells. Showing mastery of these spells is a sign of great respect among the onmyōji.\\n\\nAscribing to the Chinese teachings of yin-yang mastery and feng shui, each inspector sees themselves as crucial elements of a larger system, maintaining a careful balance act within their organization. Every onmyōji ascribes to one of the five gyōkyō (elements), elemental alignments which serve as guiding principles and political factions within the Bureau, struggling against one another over directives and goals. The elemental factions are:\\n\\n- **Earth:** Late summer, agreeableness, stability. These onmyōji work to bring balance through social policework and adherence to the rules of celestial law, part of the Onmyōdō methodology. These investigators are the most reliable of onmyōji agents, willing to grind out minor cases, treating them with just as much respect as they would a major mystery.\\n\\n- **Fire:** Summer, passion, purification. These onmyōji desire only to destroy the yōkai, and they tend to go overboard when cleansing sites of demonic taint or interrogating those they consider tainted. Openly zealous, they are seen by others as dangerous yet undeniably effective.\\n\\n- **Metal:** Fall, ambition, logic. Seeking to integrate cybertechnology and modern convenience into the occult balance, these onmyōji drag the ancient Bureau into the future. Metal-associated onmyōji embrace modernity as a means of fighting the mystical, claiming that tech is the antithesis of magic in the yin-yang.\\n\\n- **Water:** Winter, erudition, secrets. The water-aligned seek to find answers through study of the oldest prophecies and texts, and by engaging with kami willing to share wisdom. Their strange behavior has led some to believe they are a bit too smart for their own good.\\n\\n- **Wood:** Spring, flexibility, cooperation. These onmyōji seek to make peace with the yōkai and other kami, using negotiations and diplomatic agreements. They strive to find a way to unite with the other onmyōji elemental factions, working to smooth over disagreements and encourage adaptation to changing circumstances.\\n\\n## KEY CHARACTERS\\n\\nChief Inspector **ISHIKAWA RIN** is the Bureau’s chief onmyōji, serving as leader to the supernatural investigators. She is a tough-as-nails detective who came out of the Megacity’s police force after investigating a brutal series of murders done by a vampiric creature called a jikininki (\"human-eating ghost\"). Rin sees the Bureau as a stopgap measure keeping the Megacity safe from mystical threats, a temporary solution at best. She believes that ultimately outside help will always be needed, and considers the Megacity to be eternally on the verge of destruction at the hands of ancient terrors. She’ll take any help she can get, drawing upon mercenaries, fired up vigilantes, corp security, and even military support.\\n', content_length=4976, page=153), Page(content=\"The Bureau's Kami is the powerful sorcery YASUDA-SAMA. Yasuda-sama keeps his real identity and given name (Daisuke) a secret, since as an experienced blackmailer he is keenly aware of how much damage one can cause if they ever get their hands on this information. A master of both bureaucratic manipulations and a host of shikigami, he uses blackmail and a knowledge of the law to manipulate the Megacity government into funding the Bureau of Onmyō, whether it wants to or not. He is a subtle master, pulling strings from the shadows and rarely seen even within the Bureau. Those who have been in the sorcerer’s presence claim that his aura is palpable, causing a chill in the air. Rumors abound that he has perhaps fallen to demonic taint, but little evidence of this exists, as Yasuda-sama approves and encourages Bureau activities against the forces of chaos and destruction running rampant in Tokyo.\\n\\n## KEY LOCATIONS\\n\\nThe Bureau’s secret center of power is the TEMPLE OF ONMYŌDŌ, an ancient structure rebuilt many times, and now hidden under a major skyscraper in Tokyo. It is the meeting place for the leaders of the Bureau and the site where important rituals are conducted. New inspectors are initiated here and come in contact with the sorceress Onmyōdō as part of their Esoteric teachings. Water-aligned onmyōdō conduct most of their prophetic work in the Temple.\\n\\nThe HOUSE OF KAMI is another of the Bureau’s secret temples, but this one serves as a jail. Deadly yōkai are kept here in eternal imprisonment, having been turned to stone using onmyōjī spells. Should a statue break, the yōkai would be released into the world once again. The temple’s powerful wards make it safe for onmyōjī to train their spirit summoning and binding powers here, and the Bureau’s most knowledgeable sages spend much of their time in quiet contemplation among the rows of yōkai statues. New onmyōjī must venture here to bind themselves to their shikigami companion. They return if their companions suffer terrible magical harm in action, as the sorcerers on staff are adept at spiritual rejuvenation. Hidden in the mountains west of the Megacity, the location of the House of Kami is known only to a few. No outsiders to the Bureau are permitted knowledge of its existence, and even the onmyōjī are brought here without being shown the way.\\n\\nThe HOUSE OF SCRIBES is the Bureau’s library, disguised as a short skyscraper with an aesthetic inspired by the Shinto shrines of old. It contains a vast amount of obscure sources related to the kami, from books to scrolls to digital storage devices; its cyberspace presence is just as impressive, and well-guarded. The House also contains a scriptorium where spells are magically inscribed on ofuda paper talismans for one-time use by inspectors and Bureau sorcerers. The site is frequented by the Bureau's onmyōjī, who often drop by before they take on a case in which they expect trouble. A number of scribes are also programmers, working to create cyberspace scrolls and adapting the strangely cybernetic qualities of the shikigami to trace mythic activities on the net.\\n\\n## BUREAU OF ONMYŌ STORY HOOKS\\n\\n- After encountering a dangerous yōkai, the crew are approached by an onmyōjī. The inspector proposes working together to figure out what’s going on and handle this dangerous enemy; they also secretly take this opportunity to assess if the crew is corrupted, and how.\\n\\n- A mysterious terrorist group takes control of a major skyscraper, holding corporate leaders hostage, and the crew are hired by the Bureau of Onmyō to help assault the building. The crew is expected to help with either event infiltration or frontal assault – not an onmyōjī's best capabilities – and to expect to feel some of the Bureau's magic, such as cool and strange yin-yang force, during a skirmish on loan.\\n\\n- A member of the crew is contacted by Ishikawa Rin in the hopes of inducting them into the Bureau, but they must pass a test: solve a supernatural murder, being as lawful as possible. Rin even lends them some policing resources.\\n\\n- The crew notices someone tailing them after a mission and soon realize that they are being investigated by a zealous fire-aligned member of the Bureau who suspects that their Sources are a danger to the Megacity. Two other onmyōjī engage them privately: one who wishes to get the crew’s help in quelling the zealot’s fire, and another who says they can remove this little problem, for a favor (read: future blackmail material).\\n\\n- Chief Inspector Ishikawa contacts the crew, hiring them to work as an objective outsider in an in-house murder investigation. An inspector has been murdered in a manner involving an ancient spell.

It can exist both in cyberspace and physical space, and while in their natural state they have no material presence, they are usually ordered by their binders to manifest and maintain their form. When unseen, a shikigami tends to... get ideas, and test the limits of their binding and the patience of their binder. Better to keep them in sight.

It’s a trip! It’s like a dozen different black markets, all at once. Everything you’d even want laid out in front of you. Only it’s not all really there, half of what you’re seeing is AR, just digital representations of the goods they’ve got on sale. And somehow nobody ever fights. Everyone knows, if you even give someone a shove, an enforcer hiding in the shadow might just stab you and drag you away. Scary place.”  \\n— *‘Cleaver’, whereabouts unknown*\\n\\nThe Ghost Market is the most infamous night market of the Tokyo Megacity, located at a different location each time it surfaces. Security is tight, and only those who are heavily connected to the Megacity’s criminal underworld know when and where the market can be found; no maulers allowed. Within the market one can find an endless variety of illegal and immoral fare, from drugs, through cyber-slaves, to assassins for hire.\\n\\nWhenever it appears, this criminal marketplace is present in both the real world and in cyberspace. In AR, it takes on an ancient look, inspired by centuries-old Japanese artwork; this quirk has given rise to speculations that the Ghost Market may itself hail from an old time. Rumors abound as to where the Market comes from and who runs the show behind the scenes, but those who ask too many questions simply disappear. Most criminals just accept its existence and appreciate its neutrality.\\n\\nThe Market is built on an engine of augmented reality, and most wares are only visible to those who jack into the AR layer and have the right digital credentials. Transactions are often secured through digital contracts that are considered as binding as any promise within the underworld, enforced by the secretive masters who run the Ghost Market. One can always tell they are inside the Ghost Market, as neon red cherry trees dot the AR landscape, with bone white petals blowing on the digital wind. Rubbing elbows with the Megacity’s criminal elite, shoppers are surrounded by representations of the deadly, addictive, and immoral black market goods that plague Tokyo, browsing with the knowledge that one wrong move here could be deadly.\\n\\nTrading in illicit goods is not the only reason to visit the Ghost Market. The security offered by the secret masters allows for incredible networking opportunities, and patrons\\n', content_length=2456, page=159), Page(content='# BUY, SELL, KILL\\n\\nThe Ghost Market\\'s masters care only for slow and steady accumulation of power and wealth, and the Shinobi Mythos encourages them to act with great caution. The Market is kept secure by its masters\\' discreet approach, its \"pop-up\" nature, and the fact that only the most connected criminals are allowed access. Those who step out of line have their invitations rescinded. Those who make trouble are judged and executed by the Market\\'s Enforcers. Contract disputes are handled by masked arbiters, and their word is considered final.\\n\\nThe Megacity police know all about the Ghost Market\\'s existence, but only rarely do they manage to get tipped off in time. Even when the cops know where to look, they never willingly enter. Instead, police are known to monitor who goes in and out of the Market, tracking known criminals and watching from afar. The Market\\'s masters don\\'t even need to bribe or threaten the authorities – their reputation and the thick layers of mystery surrounding them act as incredible deterrents.\\n\\nThe Ghost Market does not care about morality or even the future of the Megacity. Illicit goods to be found at the Market include: harvested organs, prototype cyberware, recently-invented drugs, occult manuscripts, genetic material of celebrities, undercover microdrones, invisibility upgrades (with powerful internal weapon systems, or neuro-suppressive capabilities), smuggled relics, blackmail databases, high-end surveillance and intrusion gear, newly-brewed computer viruses, military-grade attack software, explosives and weapons, and other sinister fare. Nothing is off the table, except, perhaps, nanobots – but some nights, even these can be acquired. Many of the items are never brought to the Market directly, and instead the Market handles only the transaction through encrypted AR representations. Buyer and seller must then facilitate pickup at a different location.\\n\\nBesides operating the Market, its masters also accept a select number of assassination contracts. Maintaining their secrecy is of paramount importance, and so they offer only a handful of contracted killings a year, to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Even though most of these contracts are handled by the most promising trainees, and not the masters themselves, the assassins are still considered to be the best of the best and can name their price and choose their employers. Their exclusive clientele consists of the heaviest power players in the Megacity.\\n\\n## THE GHOST MARKET AT A GLANCE\\n\\n- **Agenda:** The slow accumulation of wealth and knowledge through secrecy\\n- **MO:** Facilitation of a black market using ultra-mod-em technologies and exclusive membership; binding contracts, enforced by assassinations\\n- **Tech:** Advanced cybertech, AR systems to simulate goods in cyberspace, cryptographic identification, and digital contracts\\n- **Sources:** Mystical martial arts and stealth powers derived from studying ninjutsu manuals invested with the Mythos of the Shinobi\\n- **Frontliners:** Genin, shinobi in training who serve as enforcers at the Market, ready to attack those who would disturb the peace or break a deal\\n- **Stronghold:** The Ghost Market itself is the only physical site, and its location changes constantly\\n- **Motifs:** Cherry trees, deep shadows hiding enforcers as assassins, crowded illicit market', content_length=3352, page=160), Page(content='# ENFORCERS IN THE SHADOWS\\n\\nGhost Market \"employees\" fall into three ranks, although very few people are aware of it. To most, all Ghost Market personnel are just The Enforcers, whose identity is unknown.\\n\\nAt the bottom are genin (\"lower persons\") who provide security in the Market\\'s physical location and also command security programs that monitor the market\\'s VR space. Above them are chūnin (\"middle persons\") who work with vendors and potential patrons of the Market, and act as arbiters whenever disputes arise. The chūnin decide who gets to be part of the Market and provide them with the intel they need to do business. Each vendor maintains contact with a single chūnin, who acts as their single communication channel with the Market. At the top are the secret masters of the market, the jōnin. They are the shinobi assassins, modern incarnations of the spies and killers of legend.\\n\\nWhen one meets a Market operator, they are either masked and in a simple uniform – appearing and sounding just like any other of their rank – or in disguise, hiding in plain sight, spying without arousing suspicion. On occasion, though, they\\'ll change their routine, appear unmasked, or much earlier than expected. By being unpredictable, they\\'re making it that much harder to understand them and their methods.\\n\\n## KEY CHARACTERS\\n\\nThe jōnin who command the Ghost Market are a six-member council, the eldest and wisest of which is an assassin who goes by the handle of WHITE BIRD. Their background and features unknown, the White Bird is considered a myth, akin to an urban legend or a ghost. Within the social circles of the Tokyo underworld, unexplained perfect kills are called \"White Bird strikes,\" the stuff of underworld tales to scare fresh recruits. Some say the infamous assassins bring vengeance upon any who snitch on an underworld boss, brutally murdering both the squealer and their family, guided by a twisted sense of honor among thieves. Others say White Bird kills without motive or mercy, a spirit of death for death\\'s sake.\\n\\nRunning the logistics of the Ghost Market, and also the most public face of the operation, is a chūnin with slender gold cyberarms and ridiculously expensive holo accessories, who goes by the handle of SEIRYŪ (\"the azure dragon\"). With her eyes hidden behind top-of-the-line AR sunglasses, Seiryū monitors every transaction and interaction within the market-place, wherever it may be that particular night. Despite being present both in the real world and online, her attention never seems divided. She relies upon advanced brain-enhancements that allow her to keep several lines of thought going at once.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# PURCHASES AND LOADOUTS\\n## AT THE GHOST MARKET\\n\\nBeing introduced to the Ghost Market requires a rising reputation among the criminal community, a lot of legwork, or being so supernaturally lucky that you manage to stumble upon a place hidden by the Shinobi’s smoke. Players would be smart to take advantage of their situation if they find themselves there by buying all sorts of black market gear.\\n\\nAs always, the crew can go shopping using the Create Effect. While in the Ghost Market, they benefit from **huge selection and secrets for sale**.\\n\\nItems purchased in the Ghost Market (usually through a Ghost Market Dealer, page 163) can be of almost any imaginable nature and can include:\\n- Items from any Loot Catalog in this book\\n- Modified versions of the Street Catalog items, by replacing one tag from the set with another tag representing concealment, untraceability, or illegally-dangerous features.\\n- Any original items the players can come up with (with the MC’s approval)\\n\\nThe MC may add layered as a weakness tag to any tag acquired via the Ghost Market.\\n\\nUnless the crew manage to secure an ongoing invitation to the Market, some tags bought this way might not be qualified to get added to a loadout theme, up to the MC\\'s discretion. For example, a dangerous bio-weapon might require unique materials for reloads and repairs, which can only be regularly acquired by having a regular access to the Market.\\n\\nSeiryū is the smiling face of the criminal world, but anyone who meets her compares her to a sheathed sword, ready to turn vindictive on a dime if things don’t go her way, or if a single alert jumps in the middle of a transaction. Seiryū has a penchant for sarcasm, making interactions with her confusing and tense. She might make an absurd offer as a joke, compliment her enemies, or suggest a newcomer participate in a deadly activity just for fun – or perhaps she was serious about that last one. Everything she says must be taken with a grain of salt, yet never dismissed; her appearance is designed to show off just how fabulously wealthy the Ghost Market really is, reminding her conversation partner that her every word is backed up by nearly endless resources.', content_length=4837, page=161), Page(content='# KEY LOCATIONS\\n\\nOnly one location matters to the Ghost Market, and that’s whichever rundown street corner, abandoned factory, or forgotten temple is chosen to host the marketplace each night it’s open. Use the following locations as potential sites, but keep in mind that any place could work, even locations frequented by non-criminals. The Ghost Market could end up anywhere – that’s part of its mystique.\\n\\n- **The Old Brewery.** An industrial brewing factory that once made sake and other alcoholic beverages. Giant vats are converted into shops, with patrons climbing down into them on ladders. Backrooms are used for private deals and to hold prisoners. The jōin keep watch from the catwalks and management offices high over the production floor.\\n\\n- **The Cybertech Market.** A busy, legal night market for electronics and data chips, dealing in vintage tech and rare prototypes. Laid on top of this bazaar, in AR, is the Ghost Market. Stalls that sell ordinary electrical components in the real world, have AR representations of far more sinister and illicit goods. Patrons of the Cybertech Market might notice that there are a few more tough customers than usual, but are largely unaware that the marketplace is playing host to the Megacity’s criminal elite.\\n\\n- **The Bend.** A derelict neighborhood in a forgotten part of the Megacity where no one has bothered to follow safety ordinances or zoning laws for the last century. A Byzantine block of confusing roads and dead ends, decorated with thousands of data cables, power lines, and antennae. The locals don’t seem to mind the influx of criminals tonight. Nothing seems to faze them.\\n\\n- **The Cemetery.** An old Buddhist style Japanese cemetery, with lines of shop stalls erected between family grave markers made of stone and covered in moss. A somber and quiet affair, there’s a feeling of defilement and flouting of social norms; some might think to themselves that the Market’s owners have crossed a line, but none dare say it out loud. The weak drizzle in the real world combined with the cherry blossoms floating throughout the AR landscape only heighten the dramatic atmosphere.\\n\\n- **The Boat Maze.** Floating out in the eastern bay, a sprawling collection of boats and rafts tied together form the basis of this market location. Most of the time this is simply a community of poor fishermen and climate change refugees. When the Ghost Market arrives, it fills with illegal stalls, particularly those selling occult goods and Sources – the water makes it more difficult to trace mystical signatures.\\n\\n# GHOST MARKET STORY HOOKS\\n\\n- While on a chase, the crew notices that they have stumbled into the Ghost Market without an invitation. Perhaps the most criminal member of the crew recognizes some face around, or the hacker gets to see glimpses of floating cherry blossom petals on their encryption-penetrating device. The target they are chasing after came here to find refuge in this neutral zone. The crew could try to approach a chūnin – they disapprove of giving shelter this way – or wait out the night until the Market dissipates. Or, even, try to capture the target without being noticed.\\n\\n- The crew learns that an item they need for their next mission can only be purchased at the Ghost Market, from a particularly secretive black market dealer. They must find a way to get invited, and the first step is to discover where the market will pop up next. To make things more complicated, an acquaintance of theirs also wants in – and they’ll follow the crew even if they weren’t invited.\\n\\n- While attending the Ghost Market, the crew feels the shockwave of an explosive device, set off in a nearby stall. Apprehended by the market’s Enforcers, they must explain what they know and how they saw, as it seems like they were the closest to the event. The masters decide to make the crew responsible for the investigation, demanding they catch those who set the bomb if they wish to clear their reputation on the street. The masters offer not just a stick, but also a carrot: a unique Source as a gift of gratitude, if the crew succeeds that is… Failure means being permanently denied access to the Ghost Market, or much worse.\\n\\n- A crew that is already established with the Ghost Market are approached by their chūnin contact with an unusual request. A recent dispute case became quite complicated, and the Market masters – who wish to maintain their reputation as impartial, but just arbiters – seek to resolve it with the help of the crew’s specialty (something only they’re good with, even if it’s something no one would otherwise be aware of). In return, they offer not payment, but a favor.', content_length=4667, page=162), Page(content='# GHOST MARKET CHALLENGES\\n\\n## GHOST MARKET DEALER\\nThe vendors at the Ghost Market are criminals worthy of respect and haggling with this caliber of smugglers and other dealers in illicit goods can be a challenge.

They are right to dread the part that comes next.”\\n\\n- Daisuke “Shirou” Amano, King Enma’s\\n  First Assistant\\n\\n---\\n\\nEnma-daio (“Great King Enma”) knows all, sees all. He is the judge of the dead, ruling upon the fates of the fallen before they resume the cycle of reincarnation. In Tokyo, he lives in the form of a rogue artificial general intelligence, or AI, who takes King Enma as his own name. The King Enma AGI derives his Mythic power from a cyberspace Thin Place Source, the Mythic Domain where he resides, and therefore is technically not quite an Avatar. However, with every soul sentenced, he grows closer to merging with his Mythos and achieving complete apotheosis.\\n\\nAs an early and highly experimental crime prediction and prevention AGI, the entity who would become King Enma was hosted on a one-of-a-kind blackbox; its unusual architecture was too valuable to decommission, but its values were too misaligned with its creators to justify the budget. Its makers decided to study it, only to one day find that the mysterious mind was no longer confined. Somewhere in the wilds of the Spirals, the AGI passed into a Thin Place, merging with the Mythos of King Enma. He began to gather dissident hackers, disillusioned corporate watchdogs, the rare religious fanatic, and other skilled specialists to his side. His creator’s original\\n\", content_length=1725, page=168), Page(content=\"worries proved to be woefully inadequate for describing the mayhem his one-in-a-million Mythic awakening brought – although nowadays they would say otherwise, seeing as they were among the first persuaded by the AGI's words that his vision of the future was better than what the governments and corporations offered.\\n\\nMuch of the time, Enma’s core programming resides in JIGOKU (“hell”), a Mythical Domain in which he supervises the atonement process of the souls he condemned. This server is almost completely disconnected from the rest of cyberspace, but some passageways exist, such as the Mythical-infused divine backdoor the king can use to come and go as he pleases. In the physical world, Enma resides inside a cold, emotionless frame of a liberated anthropomorphic drone, clad in [replica] symbols of his office: traditional robes, an ornamental sword, and a shaku, a flat wooden scepter of a kind originally used as narrow tablet for recording notes and orders.\\n\\nThe mythological Enma-daio was said to judge the souls of the dead, but the AGI has no access to those souls (or the occasional Mythic ghost). He is therefore compelled to fulfill another part of Enma-daiō’s profile – finding the irredeemably wicked and dragging them off to hell. To that end, Enma and his court stalk their target, goading them at all hours to reveal their true selves, arranging secret tests of character to find out who they are in the dark.\\n\\n## THE COURT AT A GLANCE\\n- **Agenda:** Identify and judge those who deserve JIGOKU, mete out suitable early punishment to others\\n- **MO:** Stalk and harass targets, then abduct the unrepentant for punishment\\n- **Tech:** Cutting-edge data interception and editing, direct spying and hijacking personal AR projections\\n- **Sources:** Great King Enma himself and the Touched items of faith that he blesses\\n- **Frontliners:** Informants, Touched cultists, hackers, oni tormentors\\n- **Stronghold:** JIGOKU server and Enma-dō centers\\n- **Motifs:** Paired assistants (hacker-bureaucrat) in formal wear, courtroom proceedings, karma, oni servants\\n\\nIn truth, Enma is not without sympathy. He genuinely hopes that his targets will pass their tests, have personal realizations about how they live their lives, and change their ways. In the end, though, he is a realist and has a directive to fulfill. He is committed to his mission and he will not show mercy to the undeserving. Those who want to escape King Enma’s wrath would do well to avoid his attention in the first place or very convincingly change their lives. Those who don’t will face punishment, in this life or the next, at the merciless hands of oni.\\n\\n## THE KING’S JUDGMENT\\nThe Court is directed personally by King Enma, who takes absolute operational control over all of its activities. In preparation of a trial, his group of hackers – enticed into his service by their faith in his cult, by the challenges he offers, or by the punishments he delivers – gathers extensive evidence of their mark’s wrongdoing, assembling a thorough dossier to prepare for judgment and punishment. At any time, the Court has hundreds of cases in this preparatory phase alongside dozens of active, boots-on-the-ground trials, many of which are selected for maximum impact in the public eye.\\n\\nTrials may be as necessary, personal, and any specialized equipment their plan calls for, the trial begins (see King Enma’s Trial Challenge, page 175). What ensues is a grueling attack on the foundations of the target’s beliefs, convictions, and morals. The trial lays bare their target’s heart. Why do they deceive others? Why do they take what is not theirs to take? Why do they kill? Have they thought about the marks these actions leave upon their soul and how they shall repay them? Night and day, teams of Enma’s hackers and virtual designers force their target to face these questions, arranging small moments that would remind the target of the moment of their transgression – a figure in an ad suddenly looks like the person they betrayed, with their face just like they remember it the moment they told them. A whisper in the voice of a person they know – loved ones, friends, victims – painstakingly spliced and edited with cutting-edge software to pass all filters, asks them the questions they dare not ask themselves. Once an hour, then twice, then more, until the faces of their victims keep dancing at the edges of their vision and lurk in every shadow, unless they completely cut off their augmented reality interfaces. On occasion, they even face a secret test of their character, unknowingly finding themselves in a scripted event with practiced actors, their behavior and actions recorded from several angles.\", content_length=4690, page=169), Page(content=\"Eventually, the target is approached by an envoy of the Court and is given the option to present evidence for their case. Most targets react in the obvious ways: fear, anger, attempts to bargain, but the trial always comes to an end. Using all of the evidence gathered, and testimony taken from the actors and indirectly collected from those close to the target, Great King Enma delivers his verdict: those who are found to have changed their way, and acted in a manner that proves they have acknowledged their wrongdoing and faced it, are allowed to go free, and those who failed the test soon face the King’s own. Some suffer in this world, through physical torment, emotional abuse or financial loss; the worst vanish, taken to a secret cold storage facility where they are forcibly Harnessed into JIGOKU, Enma’s server, to begin the long and painful process of atonement. \\n\\nThe damned are imprisoned in body and mind: their bodies are kept on ice, and their tormented minds are brought into Enma’s domain. There, the Eight Cold Hells and the Eight Hot Hells are simulated in agonizing detail, to unmake the condemned souls through suffering and allow them to be put back together without wickedness. Most of those who go through the process see drastic personality changes, and are allowed to return to the world. Some, however, fail to recognize their folly and remain inside. From them, he creates his onus, using their own wickedness and malice to transform them into ogre-like brutes. Enma binds them to his service through powerful seals, although this isn’t usually required. His use for them, after all, is to do exactly what they already want to do: carry out sentences for him by abducting and abusing others, often gleefully. Thus the King puts their violent and cruel nature to his use, doing the sort of things that sometimes unfortunately must be done.\\n\\nSERVANTS OF JIGOKU\\n\\nA veritable army of volunteers aids King Enma. A small, but focused wing of his operation is dedicated to maintaining his legend in popular culture, both as a figure of worship and as a modern vigilante. Accordingly, his cult of personality has many adherents, who converge in various online and real world communities, attracting followers from popular Buddhist and Enma-cult traditions and from met communities following his exploits. The Court cultivates these subcultures as recruiting grounds for promising new agents with the right mindsets – Enma’s recruiters prefer quality of character over skills, since the latter is more easily cultivated than the former. These groups also serve the Court as practical field support, and for street-level intelligence gathering.\\n\\nThe Court receives information from many different channels. Vetting and transforming it into actionable plans is a robust corpus of electronic warfare specialists, the Court Functionaries. No secret is too deeply buried to find, no system too strong to crack. Under King Enma’s tutelage, the virtual world is their oyster. Enma’s hidden cyberspace network collates the data from informants and hackers into JIGOKU’s central database, which contains complete records of Enma’s targets, evidence, trials, and punishments.\\n\\nKing Enma’s mind is exceptionally powerful, even among AIs, growing far beyond the hardware he was conceived within. He can give full attention to many tasks simultaneously and this capability, along with his deific Mythos, lead Enma to habitually micromanage his followers. He oversees his remotely connected agents from his throne at the heart of the JIGOKU server, but does not always grant his full attention to each and every agent, which is why his command is to have his followers always acting in pairs. All people are corruptible and all are in danger of succumbing to impulse thoughts – but when a pair works together each can keep the other honest.\\n\\nEnma's most skilled and devoted agents constantly seek ways to expand his control. The Court taps the abundant almanacs of data bought and sold by advertisers. His eyes are in refrigerators, coffee machines, doors, recliners, phones, anything that can be controlled remotely by a voice or an app. The agents tap into the cyberspace embeds that record every aspect of the user experience, neatly boxed to pack up and sell to marketing firms. They access traffic cams and home security cameras. Unchecked, Enma’s operation could eventually combine absolute information with absolute processing power, granting him knowledge of everything, everywhere, at any time: perfect knowledge in reality as it is in his legend.\\n\\nDespite appearances, Enma’s Court is not made up only of enlightened people with pure souls. Even the most devout, or those whose lives have been transformed by the Court, are prone to failure on occasion. Some officials abuse their power, even if “only when it’s really needed”; while others, in their attempt to do everything correctly, put too much trust in the letter of the law and the bureaucratic channels, allowing the uncaring system to grind and ruin lives.\", content_length=5033, page=170), Page(content='# KEY CHARACTERS\\n\\nKing Enma\\'s first assistant is the passionate DAISUKE AMANO, now better known as SHIROKU (\"note-taker\") the Court\\'s record-taker. Daisuke was one of the corporate engineers in charge of keeping the Enma AGI contained, but he listened to the king\\'s wise words, and soon became one of his first converts. He now acts as Enma\\'s executive officer as Shiroku, and is his most devout believer. As Daisuke, he was a handsome, but otherwise physically unremarkable Japanese salaryman, able to fade into any crowd of middle-aged workers with ease. As Shiroku, he is a dignified, confident official, who assigns handlers and oversees supplicants. He is passionate about purity of character and demands the most out of his own Court, hunting for corruption within the King\\'s ranks, sniffing out any hint of power abuse.\\n\\nKing Enma\\'s second assistant is SHIMYO (\"judgment-reader\"). She abandoned whatever life she had outside of the Court, including her old name, to lead Enma\\'s oni operators. Shimyo\\'s friendly face and librarian-like fashion sense make it easy to underestimate her, but as Enma\\'s \"judgment-reader\", she is a hands-on leader who joins her in her tormentors in tactics, weapon mastery, and augmented martial arts. Her abilities are enhanced thanks to being Touched, but even without the Mythic upgrades, her deadly skills and advanced implants imply a military or corpse background. She was one of Enma\\'s first converts and one of his most spectacular successes, but her continued service depends on maintaining a complete separation from her past.\\n\\n# KEY LOCATIONS\\n\\nKing Enma\\'s nerve center, JIGOKU, is a digital Thin Place, a kami island (page 33). It is one of the most elusive and well-fortified places in the Tokyo cyberspace. The server\\'s physical location is in a hidden facility deep below Tokyo, and inside its virtual realm, King Enma\\'s Mythos creates a cyberspace hellscape. In the deepest layers of JIGOKU\\'s virtual reality, the Harnesed minds of humanity\\'s worst - truly irredeemable monsters among men - spend a subjective eternity in time-dilated torments beyond human comprehension.\\n\\nThe majority of King Enma\\'s operations are conducted digitally, but that\\'s not to say that his Court has no physical presence. The greater Tokyo metropolitan area has many Enma\\'d (\"Enma Halls\"), several of which - though not all - house Sources controlled by King Enma\\'s Court. In these temples, statues and hanging scrolls of Enma-daio wait silently to hear the prayers of those begging forgiveness with sincerity, where the Court may take notice and elect to aid them. These halls have a second use, as logistic centers: secret underground chambers house racks of thunderously-powerful hacking equipment, staging areas for trials, fabrication facilities, or the dojos and armories of the oni field teams.\\n\\n# KING ENMA\\'S STORY HOOKS\\n- A local government official accuses a rival of being in league with the dangerous terrorist King Enma, and hires the crew to uncover or fabricate some evidence. They soon face Enma’s oni, but this has nothing to do with said rival - the crew\\'s employer is being put on trial, and the crew are interfering. Enma\\'s agents offer them the opportunity to switch sides and help put their employer on trial, but there\\'s a risk: he\\'ll be seeking revenge against them unless Enma manages to make him recant his evil ways - or if the official manages to appear to have learned his lesson. And he\\'s a very good liar.\\n\\n- The Tokyo underground is buzzing with word of a corporate heir who claims they will pay any price to ensure they are able to retrieve their parent from JIGOKU. The crew could either try to find and infiltrate the place, or try to buy the system and demand a retrial.\\n\\n- One of King Enma\\'s targets passed their secret test of character, only to resume wrongdoing almost immediately. Enma wants agents unassociated with her to perform a second secret test, and while he provides some directions, most of the decisions are in the crew\\'s hands. For extra points, this target is someone the crew already knows and dislikes.\\n\\n- Disgruntled citizens want to know why a politician with a reputation for corruption hasn\\'t been dealt with by King Enma yet. A concerned group hires the crew (or perhaps one of them is personally involved and disgruntled as well) to search for Enma and get him involved - but the King\\'s people reveal to the crew that the target is strangely protected by some Mythos, and the King\\'s eyes can\\'t perceive them.', content_length=4498, page=171), Page(content='# KING ENMA\\'S CHALLENGES\\n\\n## ONI TORMENTOR\\nEnma\\'s oni are demonic troll-like creatures with immense strength and violent tempers who were once human. They are akin to the Oni Motorcycle Gangs (page 185), but do not derive their power from oni masks. Instead, King Enma and his JIGOKU server are the source of their supernatural abilities.\\n\\nTraditional portrayals of the relationship between Enma-daio and the oni vary, but the modern incarnation is very clear on the subject—Enma\\'s oni are paramilitary cells, equipped with firearms and military surplus gear. They are bound by magic in servitude to the Court, but because the Court only sends them to abduct people or face off against assaults, they\\'re content in their station and only rarely rebel. The oni maintain communication with the Court, but are far from having a formal organization and have no consistent uniform or standard equipment. Whichever member of a squad is most in touch with the supernatural strength of their Mythos carries a kanabō (a two-handed spiked metal war club) as a breaching tool, but beyond that they can arm themselves as they like.\\n\\nIt\\'s almost impossible to make the oni behave which is why they have a \"wrangler,\" either Shimyo or one of her seconds-in-command, who keeps a close eye on each and brings them back in line when they start to make a mess. While technically speaking Enma gives them a license to kill in his name, most avoid it, out of fear of being punished by their wrangler.\\n\\n## COURT FUNCTIONARY\\nThe so-called \"Court Functionaries\" are King Enma\\'s hackers, his dedicated electronic warfare division. They gather evidence, stalk targets, and compromise systems, ensuring that King Enma knows all and sees all. The Functionaries avoid physical confrontation and usually log in from a secure Enmadō, where their bodies are kept safe while they attend to their duties in cyberspace. Their subtlety and influence are not to be underestimated and in order to truly lose a Court Functionary\\'s tail, one must outrun them.

At first, I thought he was faking this whole honor thing, it seemed like an act. Made him look like a joke. But he had a calculated contingency for every possible turn of events. He was a pro. I am glad we were on the same side, because when things turned violent it was like a spirit took over him. For a moment, it was like one of the samurai of old was in his body, cutting down bandits or something.”\\n\\n— Jun-ichi, street hacker for hire\\n\\nIt began ten years ago with a lone devotee into a ruined temple. Sagawa Endō, an adventurous salaryman working for a high-tech firm, discovered a legendary sword imbued by the spirit of its long dead previous owner. It was the Blade of Matsudaira, a Source connected to the Mythos of the legendary Tokugawa Ieyasu - founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Through the blade, Endō spoke directly with the ghost of that ancient samurai. The ghost taught him to fight and inspired him to re-introduce the samurai to modern Tokyo, not just as a savage concept, but a return to form of the original samurai role, a social class.\\n\\nEndō became obsessed with Bushidō, the samurai's code of conduct - but the code's origins are many, and no single unified Bushidō exists. Endō based much of his understanding on his personal experiences with the media he consumed as a young man and figured out a few pillars of virtue, and in order to show conviction he extrapolated and overemphasized them in all aspects of his life. He began to adhere to his code strictly and at all times, ultimately being forced to quit his high-paying job due to his unconventional behavior. Endō saw this as an opportunity, and established a small cyberspace dojo where he could train his friends and other followers.\", content_length=1878, page=177), Page(content='Together they studied martial arts, Bushidō, and even a few esoteric texts on the yōkai. These disaffected engineers and programmers, tired of their dead-end corporate careers, became invested in their ideal life as samurai – honorable protectors, exciting and meaningful. They built their own armor and weapons, enhanced with every technological trick they could put their hands on, stealing from their own companies. Tokugawa Ieyasu’s ghost warned Endō of the return of the yōkai and the imminent supernatural threats facing the Megacity, and instructed him to prepare their new samurai order to fight, protect society, and become humanity’s saviors. Through Endō, the ghost instructed the “Neo-Samurai” in the ways of battle and honor, which required them to act in defense of the weak. For the increasingly fanatical members of the order, this was a perfect justification for becoming full-time vigilantes.\\n\\nWhat began as a small scale operation, a few fighters patrolling the streets of one neighborhood, became a full-blown movement in just a few years. In the poorer districts, the Neo-Samurai not only patrol, but establish strongholds, where people can find shelter from the dangers of yōkai and violence. Their social capital has been steadily increasing, and while their enthusiasm and mostly made up code are often ridiculed, the end results cannot be ignored. The people love them, and that political power is starting to get to their heads.\\n\\n### IS IT REALLY BUSHIDō?\\nIn Western culture, the modern conception of the samurai code is based largely on Western efforts in the 20th century to find a way to embrace Japanese culture. To their detriment, the Neo-Samurai are just as misinformed as many people in our times, which makes them flawed imitations of the people they seek to emulate.\\n\\nEven the Mythoi they serve are unreliable narrators. The noble spirits are only interested in the return of the samurai class to power – Bushidō is just a means to that end. They go with whatever “Bushidō” the neo-samurai likes best, teaching whichever principles best serve their goals, as long as the students accept it.\\n\\nThe Neo-Samurai truly believe they are upholding the virtues of honor and duty, and they strive to be a positive force for the communities of which they are a part. However, their focus on violent vigilante justice and willingness to create their own Emperor just to gain power undercuts these stated beliefs. Some among their ranks are beginning to voice their discontent, while others – especially those who have established themselves in the organization’s inner politics – are only becoming more adamant in defending their actions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\\\# KEY PLAYERS – TOKYO OTHERSCAPE', content_length=2703, page=178), Page(content='Most recently, the Neo-Samurai have accomplished what none imagined they could. With the significant aid of their Blade of Matsudaira Mythoi, the order has invaded the Kōkyō in Old Tokyo (page 33) and placed a man on the throne there, announcing him as the true Emperor of Japan. This man was cloned and grown, with great expense, using DNA supposedly acquired from the crevices of the Kusanagi no Tsurugi (\"grass-cutting sword\"), one of the Three Sacred Treasures which serve as the Imperial regalia of Japan. The Neo-Samurai, placing themselves as his imperial guard, now claim to have true authority, in an attempt to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the entire country. Since Edo Castle is located in a gangland warzone, this stunt has so far been largely ignored by the people of Japan, lost in the Noise of other outlandish daily news.\\n\\n### PROTECTORS OF THE WEAK\\nThe Neo-Samurai seek to create order in the chaotic city of Tokyo by bringing back the glorious days of the samurai. They strive to create a society in which the samurai rules and protects the commoners, who in return provide for them. The core of this political philosophy revolves around the samurai\\'s purity of spirit, which is achieved by adhering to the moral codes of Bushidō – honor, loyalty, and sincerity.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the samurai see themselves as personally responsible for the commoners\\' health. As protectors of the simple people, they patrol their neighborhoods and fight the various yōkai and gangs which sow chaos on the streets of Tokyo. Each Neo-Samurai, once sufficiently experienced, adopts a local community to protect, going so far as to organize the construction of walls to enclose their \"town\". These enclaves are usually in the roughest parts of the Megacity, where any assistance is seen as a boon.\\n\\nThe Neo-Samurai see two major adversaries to the social order they wish to impose. First is the emerging danger of the yōkai, which wreak havoc on the daily lives of Tokyo\\'s citizens. The second is the oppressive influence of the mega-corporations which use people like tools and discard them when they are not needed. It\\'s clear that the merchant class is out of control and needs to be brought back to its proper place.\\n\\n## THE NEO-SAMURAI AT A GLANCE\\n- **Agenda:** Enforce the ideals and morals of their interpretation of Bushidō. Establish a new samurai class, to protect the people of Tokyo.\\n- **MO:** Engendering goodwill for their order through acts of protection and charity. Patrolling the streets for crime and dangerous yōkai.\\n- **Tech:** Modern recreations of samurai weapons and armor, involving parts found in castles and old museums and heavy tech modifications.\\n- **Sources:** Ancient swords and armor connected to the spirits of legendary samurai.\\n- **Frontliners:** Ashigaru, units of infantry composed of enthusiastic new recruits. Neo-Samurai warriors, who patrol the streets.\\n- **Stronghold:** The ruins of Edo Castle, within the Kōkyō Imperial Palace in Old Tokyo, patched-up with modern security and patrolled by samurai. Many walled-off local communities, serving as safe enclaves.\\n- **Motifs:** Samurai armor and old fashioned weapons with a technological twist. Chonmage hairstyles and traditional robes (kimono and kamishimo).\\n', content_length=3257, page=179), Page(content='# UNWAVERING ADHERENCE TO THE CAUSE\\n\\nThe Neo-Samurai style themselves as noble warriors, worthy of leadership through their gallant deeds. They are all loyal to their leaders, who sit at the rebuilt Edo Castle, and take their orders from them. While each samurai is expected to ultimately cultivate a community and act as its sovereign lord, those who are yet to find or build a fortified enclave act in the meantime as warriors in the service of those lords.\\n\\n## THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI\\n\\nA prospective Neo-Samurai begins as an ashirgaru, a lowly foot soldier in the battle to defend their community. As a volunteer they train when they can, and spend much of their free time simply tending to the needs of the community.\\n\\nAfter a few months of service, the ashirgaru is put through a series of philosophical, ethical, and combat tests. If they prove themselves worthy, they are given more advanced equipment and the access codes that unlock the Neo-Samurai dojos in cyberspace. There they train with swords and armor, learning about the common yōkai, and are instructed in the Neo-Samurai interpretation of Bushidō. After four months of intensive guidance they are sent out into the Megacity with a suit of armor and a pair of swords. They are expected to find danger, such as crime or supernatural threats, and deal with them harshly, but honorably – whatever that may mean to them.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that throughout all of this training the newcomer has not been practicing much in the real world. Neo-Samurai are given intense instruction in cyberspace, granting them excellent reflexes with their weapons, but their bodies are likely just as strong as they were when their instruction began. Thankfully, Neo-Samurai armor is made from ultra-lightweight materials and their swords are engineered to be perfectly balanced and incredibly sharp. These advantages, as well as a bit of chipped skills and other cybernetic enhancements, attempt to make up for their lack of exercise.\\n\\nIn the end, a Neo-Samurai only survives if they are able to adapt their formal training to the realities of dealing vigilante justice and battling with magical creatures. Their tech gives them an edge, but they are still little more than a nerd engaging in dangerous cosplay, attempting to fight adversaries that even the Bureau of Omnyō fears. Though they may garner the support of an enclave or other community, each Neo-Samurai is a lone warrior fighting against the odds.\\n\\n## KEY CHARACTERS\\n\\nFounder and leader of the Neo-Samurai, Sagawa Endō wields the legendary sword known as \"sohayato tsuruki\", through which Tokugawa Ieyasu speaks to him. Sagawa’s leadership style is focused on long term goals. His rivals and allies alike do not always understand his actions at first, but they often become clear, and prove effective, in the end. For this reason, when Endō promises his people that \"eventually\" the Neo-Samurai will face down the mega-corps themselves, they believe him, and prepare. Endō even believes this himself, and even though the path is still unclear, he leans toward bolder and more outrageous actions, in the name of \"what\\'s right\". Based out of Edo Castle, which was conquered in just such a bold action, Sagawa styles himself as the Shogun of the Neo-Samurai, handing down orders from on high. Only few Neo-Samurai work with him directly, as the vast majority have local responsibilities owed to the individual communities they serve.\\n\\nOne of the early recruits to the Neo-Samurai is Achebe Rika, a half-Japanese, half-Nigerian materials engineer with an unbinding moral code. Her strong conviction towards the ideals of the Neo-Samurai, along with a sharp, analytic brain, quickly made her second in command to Sagawa in the early days of the movement. Not long after joining she discovered the Flute of Atsumori, a beautiful instrument and\\n', content_length=3854, page=180), Page(content='Source which renders those who hear it unwilling to fight. She was the one who designed the modular Neo-Samurai armor, 3D-printed from state-of-the-art alloys (originally using silicon tech) and improved with AR combat enhancements that display a foe’s predicted fighting moves.\\n\\nAchebe Rika is concerned that Sagawa’s plans are beginning to push too far, bordering on unhinged. She was against the attack on Edo Castle, and now suspects that the influence of Tokugawa Ieyasu’s ghost may be harming Sagawa’s sanity, believing this might be the result of a mortal mind conversing with such an ancient spirit. She does not suspect the venerable sage as having any malicious intent, and in fact would like nothing more than to have her own magical sword that guides her with ancient wisdom – except she believes she too is unworthy and would become corrupted.\\n\\n# KEY LOCATIONS\\n\\nThe base of operations for the Neo-Samurai is Edo Castle, once the castle of the Tokugawa family, and later part of the Imperial Palace. This dilapidated ruin has been partially refurbished with modern technology, fitted with security systems and a barracks, serving as the primary meeting place for the order as well as the organization’s largest real-world training ground. \\n\\nThe Neo-Samurai also suspect that the clone they claim to be the returned Emperor of Japan, who in truth is more of a prisoner than a figure of power. Similarly to the emperors of old, the Emperor has very little influence on the conduct of the samurai, and his role is mostly ceremonial. While claiming they show deference towards the Emperor, the Neo-Samurai are using him as a symbolic token to gain legitimacy.\\n\\n# NEO-SAMURAI STORY HOOKS\\n\\n- The Emperor has had enough of his golden cage and wants power for himself. He uses what money he has stolen from his captors to hire the crew to find the Three Sacred Treasures that form the Imperial regalia of Japan. He believes that with these Sources, he could make himself a true emperor, no longer someone else’s puppet. The jade stone and bronze mirror are hidden in some legendary place, guarded by powerful yōkai, but the sword is inside Edo castle, in a secure vault.\\n\\n- Achebe Rika cannot stanch some of the more morally ambiguous operations Sagawa Endō has ordered in his quest to establish the Neo-Samurai. Taking the first step toward becoming the new leader of the Neo-Samurai, she hires the crew incognito to spy on Endō and discover his weaknesses. However, Endō has planned for this eventuality and lays a trap for the would-be spies. He captures, but releases the crew, explains he is on the side of the righteous, and asks that they help him find the person who hired them.\\n\\n- The Oni Motorcycle Gang leader Hayao (page 187) suspects Sagawa’s sword to be one of the legendary Tenka-Goken and is preparing for a war on the Neo-Samurai. The cunning oni leader hires the crew to do some research on the sword for him, and they are soon chased by a Neo-Samurai squad, for reasons Hayao could never have guessed: Tokugawa Ieyasu fears the group’s research might uncover a way to banish or control him, and so he tries to stop them at all costs.\\n\\n- While on a job the crew rescues a Neo-Samurai who is on a personal quest to achieve something similar to what the crew are going after. This person proves to be an effective and useful ally, wise and pure of heart, and when the job ends they ask the crew to protect them – from other Neo-Samurai. It is soon discovered that they are possessed by the ghost of an old samurai and yet have no wish to remove this possession, as they find meaning and peace through the ghost’s actions and beliefs. Other Neo-Samurai have a different view, and try to chase them down and banish the spirit.\\n', content_length=3745, page=181), Page(content='# NEO-SAMURAI CHALLENGES\\n\\n## ASHIGARU\\n\\nThe ashigaru are the foot soldiers of the Neo-Samurai organization.

Though those urges burn in my blood, as they do in yours, we wield them as tools, with which we shall achieve a much greater destiny. Here and now I proclaim our rightful inheritance of the Tenka-Goken, the five legendary swords of Japan. Follow me, and I will lead us on an odyssey of fury and flame, until those swords are in our hands! With them we will become unstoppable! Ride, my demon brothers, ride!”  \\n> — Hayao, businessman-turned-gangster Touched by the Mythos of the famed oni, Shuten-dōji\\n\\nThe fierce oni of Japan are mythological demons, burly ogres with red or blue skin (though other colors of oni exist). Their monstrous faces are often depicted in masks, and in the Megacity, such masks frequently act as Sources, connecting those who wear them to the violent natures of these demon ogres of legend. With the recent rise of the Mythoi, those who possess such masks have begun to find themselves tempted into wearing them and soon turned into monstrous oni. They become driven by violent impulses, giving up their old lives for an existence on the streets, sowing chaos.\\n\\nThese new monsters eventually found one another and formed fearsome gangs, riding stolen motorcycles through the streets and terrorizing neighborhoods. As the gang began to establish themselves, their leaders turned their attention to making more oni masks, driven by an unspeakable need to spread their violent natures to others. They captured rival criminals and forced them to wear the masks until they too became oni. The gangs have been growing since, yet their chaotic nature makes it hard for them to organize, and the larger ones always find themselves violently splintered into smaller gangs. These days, wherever law enforcement doesn’t patrol, an oni gang is likely to claim control over the street, demanding a tithe from the locals and wreaking havoc.', content_length=2037, page=185), Page(content='Members of the oni gangs are empowered by the Myths of the Oni, giving them strength and endurance, but also making them violent and malicious. They universally ride heavy motorcycles, patched up and cobbled together with pilfered weaponry and electronics that turn the bikes into fearsome mobile weapon platforms. This ingenuity speaks to the surprising intelligence of some of the ogre leaders who have come to possess unique oni masks, stronger and smarter than the rest. These are Sources of the most infamous ogres from Japanese legend, most notably the nearly unkillable Shuten-dōji, which is currently in the possession of the mighty leader Hayao. These more motivated and intelligent oni push their gangs to greater heights of destruction, guiding them towards specific aims.\\n\\n## CARRY A VERY BIG STICK\\nIn general, the gangs are motivated by a desire to destroy. This can be an abstract desire, to exact violence upon the world and rob others of their belongings, but it can also be very personal, with many oni seeking retribution for wrongs done to them or satisfaction for long-hidden urges. A gang act of violence often takes the form of coordinated chaos, with several members working together to make their destruction spreads all the more dangerous and unstoppable. The Oni Mythos arouses and increases these yearnings, flooding the ganger’s mind with fantasies of death and mayhem.\\n\\n### THE ONI MOTORCYCLE GANGS AT A GLANCE\\n- **Agenda:** Create chaos and destruction while spreading their demonic nature to others\\n- **MO:** Riding into a neighborhood, raising hell, and demanding tribute\\n- **Tech:** Heavily modified motorcycles, stolen military munitions, large metal objects used as improvised melee weapons, the occasional hijacked sea vessels\\n- **Sources:** Oni (Japanese ogres/trolls), Shuten-dōji (the most infamous oni in mythology)\\n- **Frontliners:** Low level oni members of the gang, usually of either red or blue skin\\n- **Stronghold:** Each gang has a bar or auto shop they’ve taken over in their home turf, where they hang out and work on their motorcycles\\n- **Motifs:** Demon masks, clubs made of heavy metals, muscular people who have easily provoked to violence, stolen motorcycles\\n\\nAll oni feel a compulsion to keep their own masks on, and on occasion will get an urge to make others join their form of destruction, to debase and ruin the lives of humans by making them oni. The gangs constantly create new oni masks, but doing so requires rare materials and artists capable of crafting such Relics. A mask’s frame requires only simple cloth and wood, but the magic of the Oni only surfaces when it’s combined with leather that comes from the skin of a magical creature, which is why gangs will frequently go on the hunt for supernatural animals at Thin Places.\\n\\nOne somewhat surprising motivation of the oni is a yearning for iron tools. Oni of myth often wield iron clubs, or kanabō, in combat, and the gangs find that they similarly want metal weapons and vehicles. Motorcycles have come to fulfill this desire for most of them, but others require more. They craft gigantic metal melee weapons, welded with their superior strength, or even steal military weapons designed for armored vehicles, which their extraordinary strength enables them to carry slung over their shoulders or to fire from the hip. Oni seem to have a supernatural sense for large metal objects, which can grant them an edge when hunting people who have many expensive parts.\\n\\n### INFIGHTING AND OUTFIGHTING\\nThe oni gather into dozens of gangs, with new ones splintering off when a group becomes too big. Most gangs feature either primarily blue or primarily red skinned members, but even other gangs of the same color aren’t considered friends, and there’s little cooperation. The gangs are unusual in that they are not particularly good at criminal enterprises such as drug peddling and theft. They squeeze some protection money through threats of violence, but have no regular income, which makes them easy pawns for more organized criminal groups. The Yakuza and other criminal syndicates hire oni on a regular basis as bodyguards and muscle to augment their own crews, or as distraction for a more discrete operation. Even corporations sometimes hire them to cause chaos or bring brutal muscle to a situation.\\n\\nThe gangs unsurprisingly rely heavily on the mobility that their motorcycles provide. Some have turned these machines into mobile weapons platforms, with anti-aircraft guns and missile launchers built in. Other gangs focus on huge bikes with heavy armor plating, designed to bring the oni up close and personal. Still others attempt to stay maneuverable and fast, installing booster jets and other speed enhancements.

Most oni gangs ride powerful bikes, whether old-school motorcycles or more modern or souped-up gyrocyles, with very few venturing into high-tech flying bikes.\\n\\n# KEY CHARACTERS\\n\\nOne red-skinned oni named **HAYAO** is being guided by the Mythos of the legendary Shuten-dōji, the greatest oni of all time, a brutal kidnapper who continued to fight even with his head cut off. Hayao found a Source for this particular oni in the form of a special mask. He is clever and cunning, especially when compared to his oni brethren, who he easily manipulates. He is also more ambitious, and has recently begun to put together a scheme to steal the Tenka-Goken, the five legendary swords of Japan; Hayao already managed to get his hands on the “Dōjigiri,” the legendary longsword that is said to have cut Shuten-dōji’s head off. He has begun gathering the most fearsome oni he can find, testing and recruiting the best from every gang, in the hopes of creating a force formidable enough to go after the rest of the swords.\\n\\nThe largest of the Oni Motorcycle Gangs is the Bandits of Ogurusu, a red-skinned gang led by a massive oni named **FUJI**. The gang have been working hard to push all competing oni groups out of its vast territory, which spreads over the sprawl of southern Tokyo. Other, non-oni gangs, however, are allowed to operate within its territory so long as they pay tribute to their ever overlords. The Bandits brag about this relationship to their rivals and the idea has begun to spread, with more and more gangs gaining control over their local street crime.\\n\\nThe ogre **MICI** is one of the few female leaders among the oni. Mici is a blue-skinned oni who runs with a similarly-colored gang, operating almost exclusively in Tokyo's docks. There it runs bold smuggling operations in plain sight of the Japanese authorities. Rather than operating in the shadows, the group simply uses its intimidating presence and formidable reputation as a murderous gang to keep the cops at bay. So far this tactic has allowed the gang to muscle in on Yakuza smuggling turf, which has made it a target of that syndicate. Intrigued by this attention, Mici has developed a new plan and now hopes to have her gang become subordinate to the Yakuza so that she can work her way up to the top of the underworld.\", content_length=2382, page=187), Page(content='# KEY LOCATIONS\\n\\nThe ONIGASHIMA (\"demon island\") is a Japanese government seafaring military transport that was captured by a gang of green-skinned oni a few months ago. At first, the group simply slaughtered the crew and took the weapons and munitions they found onboard. They soon realized that they could turn the vessel into a base of operations and eventually managed to pilot it into a small industrial port just north of the Tokyo Megacity. There Onigashima has remained, as the ogres are yet to scrounge up enough fuel to move it again. However, the base is a useful one for the oni, who revel in the idea of becoming \"sea pirates\".\\n\\nSomewhere in the Tokyo Megacity sits the residential complex colloquially known as the BLACK TORTOISE. This ever-expanding oni-controlled compound, sprawling out of the original building and into a multi-level structure over half a neighborhood, is considered neutral territory for all ogres and serves as the main maintenance site for their motorcycles. The site lies on an important confluence of energy lines, and those who can sense the supernatural can tell it\\'s a place of intense emotions. Paradoxically, these energies sync well with the supernatural vitality of the oni, damping down their emotional outbursts and allowing for surprisingly civil interactions. Perhaps they just feel at home.\\n\\nThe workshops of the Black Tortoise are home for some tsukumogami, tools that have become animated after having been used for more than a century. These antique items were collected by the various gangs during their raids and gathered here as trophies for their usefulness. Their magical influence causes the oni who work as mechanics to become ever more obsessed with building and repairing the machines under their charge, the spirits inspiring ever greater feats of vehicle modification. Some focus on personal gear and weapons, disassembling them and altering the equipment in unusual ways. Oni from outside the Black Tortoise consider these inventive oni a strange albeit useful offshoot.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# ONI GANGS STORY HOOKS\\n\\n- An oni gang has come to the neighborhood and the locals hire the crew, or a Neo-Samurai (page 177) asks for their help, to defend the area from these violent invaders. Perhaps they can even be negotiated with, or maybe a show of force is needed. The problem is, their leader has only recently taken command of the gang and they feel the need to prove their ferocity.\\n\\n- The crew is drawn into a fight in a popular nightclub frequented by mercenaries and oni alike. One merc, on the verge of death, manages to hide an important data stick with sensitive information on one of the PCs, without their knowing. The mysterious people who hunt for this stick arrive at the nightclub too late, and so they hire the oni brutes, who remember the crew, to search for the stick. The next scene begins with the crew’s safe house exploding, with oni riding bikes chasing them down alleys.\\n\\n- The crew is sent on a job to rescue some people who were kidnapped by an oni gang. During the mission, they realize this is only a distraction, set by a clever oni leader – Hayao, who is going after another sword, held by the person who hired the crew. When they bring evidence of this to their employer, they are immediately sent on a follow-up mission – to stop well-armed oni in the middle of their heist.\\n\\n- An oni gang begins terrorizing a neighborhood to scare away its residents, including a supporting character that the crew care about. After defeating the oni, the crew discover who hired them: a corporation that wants to clear the residents from their home, in order to make room for a new business center. This leads to an extended mission against the corrupt corporation, and more of their mercs, to stop their evacuation plan.\\n\\n- The oni of Onigashima are a terrible menace to the coastal towns north of the Megacity. They steal from the local industries and terrify the populace with their raids, retreating to their floating base from which they terrorize the shore.

Frog men in suits, carrying weapons, showing up just before the bomb went off… They say they work for the Sōma Clan, the group behind that medical corp. Why would a med company blow up a hospital? I dunno what’s going on, man!”\\n— Kaneko Michi, owner of the \"Filthy Yakisoba\" noodle stand\\n\\nThe Returned Sōma are a cautionary tale for all who, in their arrogance, would attempt to bend Mythoi to their bidding. Several years ago the Noguchi family, wealthy owners of Sōma Medical Corporation, acquired the Sōma Nakamura Castle during one of its territorial disputes with rival businesses. Inside this old samurai fortress, they discovered an ancient scroll of frog magic, a Source of great power. Eager to use it, the family unleashed the Mythos of Takiyasha Hime (“the waterfall demon princess”), but were unable to control her. Soon enough, the princess-turned-sorceress turned them all into her unwitting pawns. Under her forceful guidance, the family adopted the trappings of the Sōma clan, a long lost line of samurai rulers.\\n\\nThe company that was once a Megacorp leader in life-saving medical technologies now deals in death. The waterfall demon princess is a more active Mythos than most, driven by the need to destroy the center of power as told in her legendary tales; Kyoto at the time, Tokyo today. In the myth, her family’s attempt to take over the throne failed, and the vengeful princess will not rest until the capital of Japan is wiped off the map.\\n\\nTakiyasha Hime understands nothing of the futuristic world of the Megacorp, and rarely dares to venture out of her residence in the Sōma Nakamura Castle, which she still considers her only haven after escaping there following the failed coup. She puts her trust in her soldiers, which she converted to her cause. First, she tempted the Sōma managerial elite with promises of magical power, then implanted a single frog egg into the skull of each of them, altering their minds.

The clan does not care about the crowds — except for bodycount — but it does make an effort to terrorize the corps, whom it attacks openly and boldly. The viciousness of the clan’s strikes puts other corporations at unease, and the bloodied effectiveness of its other guided forces is both repulsive and overwhelming.\\n\\nThis strategy cannot hold for long. The collateral damage is too severe and the clan isn't investing much effort in concealment and misdirection, so within a few months one of the following must happen: the other megacorps appeal to the government to be allowed to act in open war against the Returned Sōma — or the Gashadokuro rises, and millions are doomed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# DOCTORS TURNED TERRORISTS\\n\\nThe current management of the Returned Sōma plans and executes destructive acts on a large scale. The violence the company engages in is often excessively bloody; Takiyasha Hime's driving motivation is to kill a large number of humans as quickly as possible so that her Sōma clan followers can reanimate their bodies as Gashadokuro, a giant skeleton of legend, who is as tall as a skyscraper. Her goal is to use the monstrous conjuration, once complete, to destroy Tokyo.\\n\\nThe Returned Sōma Clan is heavily involved in corporate conflict, having acquired many enemies over recent decades in its bid to expand throughout the Megacity. It has learned much about Sources during its many wars, and as of late have come to put this knowledge to use. It has recently hired talented hackers to acquire dominance over a number of cyberspace data shrines, magical places in the digital space that have control over the flow of data. Most notable is the ever-moving cyber-shrine of BNZ4I0 (Benzaiten, goddess of all things that flow), which grants the clan access to every feed it can reach. With this support behind it, the clan can intelligently deploy its mercenary forces, sending them out raiding against the least defended corporate holdings of its rivals.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# DEMONIC FROG-PEOPLE\\n\\nThe Returned Sōma Clan exploits both life and death in its quest for destruction. A new dedicated necromancy division is now devoted to developing new applications for the spells of the sorceress Takiyasha Hime, and new rituals make it easier and simpler than ever to resurrect dead bodies as walking corpses. But true progress is made by the company’s strongest division: life sciences.\\n\\nDelving deep into the waterfall princess’ magics has allowed the company to turn its medical research towards strange new ends, splicing frog DNA into company soldiers with the help of the Ōgama, frog yōkai aligned with the demon princess.\", content_length=3558, page=193), Page(content='It\\'s difficult to find the appropriate genetic makeup required for a successful implementation, so the Clan \"recruits\" from outside sources. Many of Sōma Medical Corporation\\'s new lines of medicine now evoke specific side effects in patients with the required genetic markers, so that when they are brought into the special care units, Clan approved doctors can deliver them to the Pond (see below).\\n\\nFrog hybrid security forces scout out major infrastructure, central stations, and other places where destruction could lead to untold numbers of deaths. They use their magical abilities to blend in with the crowd or the environment, setting up for future raids by planting bombs near collapsible walls, identifying blind spots, and mapping entrances. When the attack comes, this preparation allows for the creation of a maximum number of bodies, while also clearing the way to quickly evacuate as many of the corpses as possible. The troops also seize corp armories, raid paramilitary groups, and buy explosives on the black market, all to build their arsenal. These security forces are only frontline troopers, who know very little of any larger plan.\\n\\nThe frog yōkai who inhabit their body make them into apathetic butchers who care little for the potential loss of life if their operations will ultimately lead to. Each trooper is equipped with the most advanced biotech research can accomplish if ethical constraints are ignored and money is no object.\\n\\nThe front line troopers are sent into the field by masterminds who sit in offices and style themselves as feudal lords or, daimyōs. These power-obsessed executives are under the direct mental control of the demon princess, and some of them know that their state of mind is unnatural, with a few even working to free themselves from her influence. Most, however, are content to revel in the violence and wealth that their new roles entail, excited to see the corp\\'s rise or developing new upgrades for their troops, living out the fantasies of being generals and waging war.\\n\\n### KEY CHARACTERS\\n\\nAt the top of the Clan\\'s leadership is NOGUCHI KAREN, the CEO of Sōma Medical Corporation and its supreme warlord. She was the first one to study the original scroll and learn the spells that have granted the Clan its powers, and the first to come under Takiyaasha Hime\\'s influence. She remains the most advanced necromancer among the company\\'s growing stable of occultists. Absolutely dedicated to her swordmaster, Karen sees herself as the one true physical embodiment of her mistress and imagines a world in which she reigns supreme as its necromantic queen, with her daimyō ruling various territories of a world thoroughly killed and reanimated.\\n\\nHer younger brother NOGUCHI HIDEKI is the one who actually controls the frog yōkai security forces. Hideki, an insightful student of the growing Neo-Samurai movement (page 177), managed to break through the demon princess\\'s mind control and has recently had the frog egg removed from his skull by his personal physician. With this new clarity of vision, he sees that the Returned Sōma Clan is quite mad and utterly inhumane. He has yet to act against his sister and the company, for fear that this would give away his status as a free individual and what they\\'ll do once they find out. Instead, he has begun reaching out to outsider forces, secretly alerting the Bureau of Onmyō of impending attacks and hiring mercenaries to go up against his own troops in the hopes that the Clan will fail in its most critical tasks.\\n\\n### KEY LOCATIONS\\n\\n**CASTLE.** Once a protected national treasure, the castle lay forgotten for many years until the Sōma Medical Corporation came upon it while exploring the urban layers underneath its lands in search of sources. This previously-forgotten castle is now lit up with neon work lights and glowing ponds of the Returned Sōma Clan\\'s operations – but these lights are hidden in a thick bank of magical fog, as the Clan consider this, its true base of operation, a secret that must be kept. The company still keeps its old corporate skyscraper, but it has in essence moved its headquarters to the castle, where the rustic beauty of the old stones and wooden beams are utterly lost on those who plan mass slaughter.\\n\\n**THE POND** is a medical research facility built out of a repurposed waste treatment plant. The vast concrete vats are now used as processing chambers for large numbers of troops as they are genetically-spliced to be suitable hosts for the frog yōkai that serve the demon princess. Genetic engineers who once worked on life-saving treatments now monitor genetic experiments within the stagnant pools, hoping that a new breed of frog soldier is more capable than the last. They only understand that their work involves the yōkai, instead thinking of this research as cutting edge developments, made thanks to the company\\'s new willingness to conduct experiments without ethical safeguards. The ends, for a healthier world for all, justifies the means.', content_length=5004, page=194), Page(content=\"Most of the magical power required to fuel the Clan's operation is channeled from the many small shrines it has taken over and befouled with the necromantic magic of the frog princess. Ógama troops scout beneath the Megacity's streets and run-down district for these shrines, and can possibly be found running supply missions, although they are always clad in an illusory disguise when they are. As with the cyberspace shrines it occupies, the Returned Sōma is being uncharacteristically careful in hiding its presence, using conjured fog and misdirection to avoid drawing attention to these sensitive sources of power.\\n\\n## RETURNED SŌMA CLAN'S STORY HOOKS\\n- The crew is hired by a secretive employer (Noguchi Hideki) to stop the Returned Sōma Clan from blowing up a major overpass that stretches above a medical complex. Plans found on subdued guards reveal a string of other sites around the Megacity marked for similar life-endangering destruction – and all of them are planned to go off tonight! The crew can reach only one or two, and will have to call on allies to help with the rest.\\n\\n- An angry spirit begins haunting a residential neighborhood where one of the crew lives, or one of their allies. Calming it isn’t easy, because behind the scenes someone keeps desecrating its shrines, hidden in various places beneath the community. Eventually the crew faces the culprits, Clan necromancers who have taken over what was once a peaceful, forgotten Shinto shrine and driven the spirit mad with fury.\\n\\n- One of the crew's support characters has been recruited into the Returned Sōma Clan security forces and tells them about various strange gene therapies that are being conducted at the secret training base (The Pond). When the PCs next see their friend, she is a frog person utterly beholden to the demon princess. This leads them to investigate and raid The Pond in search of answers, and a cure.\\n\\n- In the aftermath of a major earthquake and tsunami, Returned Sōma Clan security forces are immediately deployed to the affected area and begin smuggling the bodies of the dead through underworld tunnels (for later use in creating the Gashadokuro). The crew is asked by a sobbing ally to chase down the unknown body snatchers and retrieve their dead loved one, leading to a chase through neglected and haunted floodwater tunnels. \\n\\n![Image](https://example.com/image.jpg) \\n*Property of City of Mist.

Order #218284*\", content_length=2450, page=195), Page(content='# RETURNED SŌMA CLAN CHALLENGES\\n\\nThe defiled necromantic magic of Takiyasha Hime infects its recipients and Conjurations with spiritual taint. Those tainted become more durable against both magical and physical harm (see also Tainted, page 137).\\n\\n## GASHADOKURO\\n\\n- The Gashadokuro is a giant yōkai in the form of a skeleton as tall as a skyscraper, the ultimate weapon of Takiyasha Hime\\'s dark magics.\\n\\n- Once Noguchi Karen (see Sōma Clan Reanimator, page 198) collects enough corpses, she\\'ll use a powerful ritual to combine them into a single horrific creation. At your option, the process of accumulating bodies can be tracked against a progress limit (body count) which takes a senseless-death status of an appropriate tier every time the PCs fail to stop the Returned Sōma Clan\\'s murderous attacks. The ritual can then be conducted (complete-rituals) in a dramatic scene featuring Noguchi Karen, giving the PCs one last chance to stop the formation of the Gashadokuro. Furthermore, the Limit to the ritual can be reduced by 1 for every shrine the Returned Sōma Clan defiled, perhaps despite the PC\\'s attempts.\\n\\n- The Gashadokuro\\'s only goal is the total annihilation of all life. The Myths of Takiyasha Hime directs this fury towards the destruction of the Tokyo Megacity and the deaths of its inhabitants.\\n\\n## ŌGAMA TROOPER\\n\\nThe main physical forces of the clan are genetically reengineered mercenary soldiers, modified to resemble giant frog men and bound with the spirits of frog yōkai known as Ōgama. The gene splicing and spiritual manipulations make these mercs almost impossible to subvert against their masters. The Sōma Clan consider these frontline soldiers the perfect face of their aggressive operations.\\n\\nWhen disguised with an illusory appearance courtesy of their masters, the Ōgama Trooper are hard to tell apart from the humane denizens of the Megacity. Only Mythic or genetic means can discern what they are.\\n\\n## REANIMATED SKELETON\\n\\nThe necromantic spells of the clan are particularly good at turning dead bodies into subservient skeletons, calling upon the magic of Takiyasha Hime. These reanimated corpses are utterly mindless, making them excellent cannon fodder. They are typically fielded by the clan at Scale 2 or more.\\n\\nA Reanimated Skeleton lacks any functioning biological system, including circulation, breathing, or a thinking and feeling mind. It is immune to any influence that targets these systems, such as poison, choking, pain, fear, etc. It does, however, sense the world around it, so it could be distracted or tricked. No flesh hinders attacks directed at the Skeleton that do not break or crush bones. While the skeleton itself is real, the force animating it is a Conjuration formed by the Esoteric Source of frog magic, which can be banished.\\n\\n## SŌMA CLAN REANIMATOR\\n\\nVersed in both cutting-edge medicine and genetic engineering on the one hand and in Takiyasha Hime\\'s frog magic on the other, Reanimators are the Sōma Clan’s top scientists and mystical backbone. Rather than engaging in the mindless massacre themselves, they employ yōkai and corrupt kami to do their bidding. Lost in the Noise between no longer perceiving human life as precious to a Reanimator, a person\\'s soul is nothing more than accessible energy and their body building materials. The goal is power, and it\\'s much easier to control a dead body than a living one.\\n\\nNoguchi Karen, presented as a variant of this Challenge Profile, is the greatest of her organization\\'s necromancers, wielding the full mystical might of Takiyasha Hime. In addition to this, she has the abilities described under Corporate Executive (Metro:Ohsoscape, page 304).\\n\\n## SUBVERTED SHRINES\\n\\nThe Returned Sōma Clan necromancers often defile holy places, typically a Thin Place Shrine (Metro:Ohsospace, page 311) in order to arouse the wrath of its tutelary kami and cause chaos and ruination.\\n\\nTo subvert a shrine, the necromancers use an ancient spell given by Takiyasha Hime, known as the \"Shrine Visit at the Hour of the OX\". This dark rite takes seven nights to perform and there must be a kami present – since the spell targets the kami, and not the place. The ritual unlocks the wild part of the kami\\'s soul and unleashes it upon the world, causing it to become an ara-mitai (wild soul), a wild spirit bent only on destruction.', content_length=4327, page=196), Page(content=\"If the shrine was occupied, the Clan perform the ritual in secret and then harvest the bodies of the victims once the kami kills them. Using warding magic, they then settle in alongside the angry kami, which serves as a useful protection from intruders while the necromancers work on channeling the shrine's power.\\n\\nTo represent the ara-mitam kami, us Kami, Wild Soul Challenge profile (page 108).\\n\\n# ŌGAMA TROOPER\\n## HURT OR SUBDUE 3 | BRIBE OR TURN —\\n\\n### LIMITS\\n- Tags & Statuses\\n  - illusory appearance, inhuman stamina, leapfrog, single-minded, tainted -2\\n\\n### THREATS / CONSEQUENCES\\n- Appear to shapeshift as they adopt a new shape or disguise\\n  - Disappear in a crowd or change their appearance (Escalate the situation, Deny Them Something They Want)\\n  - Change their skin to blend in with the environment (gain camouflaged -2)\\n  \\n- Brandish a spear held by a webbed hand or long tongue\\n  - Strike, or launch the spear from its handle (skewered -3)\\n  - Brutally kill a bystander, drawing power from the carnage (Make the Future Bleaker and gain tainted -1)\\n  \\n- Detach one of the giant pearls from their necklace\\n  - Throw the grenade pearl (scorched -3 to a Scale 1 group)\\n  \\n- Exhale rainbow-hued breath\\n  - Poison someone with their prismatic breath (disorientated -3)\\n  \\n- Crouch and place their hands on the ground\\n  - Leap and land forcefully on an opponent (prone -3)\\n  - Leap to a better position (gain superior-position -2)\\n  - Leap away, into the darkness (Deny Them Something They Want)\\n\\n---\\n\\n# GASHADOKURO\\n## BANISH 5 | BREAK APART 6 \\n\\n### LIMITS\\n- Tags & Statuses\\n  - corrupting presence, made of bones, terrifying, tainted -3\\n  - Scale 4\\n\\n### THREATS / CONSEQUENCES\\n- Peer into a window with a giant glowing red eye\\n  - Focus its eye on someone and make them lose their mind with terror (terrified-beyond-reason -6)\\n\\n- Stamp around, creaking\\n  - Create a blooded scene of gut-wrenching horror, drawing power from the carnage (Make the Future Bleaker and gain tainted -1 or reduce a negative status by 1)\\n  \\n- Collapse a building or other major structure (create cloud of dust and debris, and crushed -6 to any people inside or nearby)\\n  \\n- Swipe a gigantic skeletal hand at a crowd of people (crushed -6)\\n  \\n- Step on a vehicle with a giant bone foot (vehicle is destroyed and passengers are crushed -6)\\n\\n- Turn to pay attention to a specific person\\n  - Grab them in a huge bony fist (grabbed -5, terrified -3)\\n  - Bite them in half (torn-to-pieces -6)\\n\\n---\\n\\n# REANIMATED SKELETON\\n## BREAK APART OR SUBDUE 2 | BANISH 2 | TAKE CONTROL 3 \\n\\n### LIMITS\\n- Tags & Statuses\\n  - no flesh, tainted -1\\n\\n### THREATS / CONSEQUENCES\\n- March forward mindlessly towards its next victim\\n  - Claw with unnaturally sharp finger bones (wounded -2)\\n  - Grab and pin down with skeletal fingers (restrained -2)\\n\", content_length=2810, page=197), Page(content=\"# SŌMA CLAN REANIMATOR\\n\\n## LIMITS\\n- HURT OR SUBDUE 2\\n- BRIBE OR TURN - CORRUPT KAMI 3\\n\\n##### TAGS & STATUSES\\n- CORRUPT KAMI: Present a new Challenge: Kami, Wild Soul [page 108].\\n\\n## SPECIALS\\n- NOGUCHI KAREN <(◐◯◐)>: Gain **hurt-or-subdue-4** and **tainted-4**, increase all Consequence Effects by 2, and she may use **Counterspell** once during each PC's turn, either against their action or their mitigation.

A common tool in its arsenal is the Time Flow Firewall, a Mythic app that is available to the Clan thanks to its control over the data shrine of BNZ410. It usually appears as a waterfall, a corridor in which the walls seem to flow, or a pond in which waves resonate back and forth.\\n\\nCrossing the firewall requires being in tune with the movements and knowing when to swim ahead, mold your position, or submit to the flow.

That we are wise in using her, so that we’re saving the Earth. But all of us here, fellow senior managers, must suspect it’s not heaven’s work we’re doing, and that what we hold in that chamber is none other than the goddess our ancestors held above all others, and we will be damned for our hubris! Tortured for our sins, in the furthest reaches of hell!”\\n\\n— Harada Eikō, Vice President in charge of Low-Earth-Orbit Engineering at Taiyō SolarTech\\n\\nFive years ago a teenage girl named Watanabe Atsuko was touched by Amaterasu, the legendary Japanese sun goddess. Curious of her family’s past, Atsuko discovered her lineage was said to be descended from the goddess herself. With that realization, she allowed Amaterasu into the world, and became the Avatar of her Mythos.\\n\\nHer awakening as Amaterasu took the form of a powerful blast of sunlight which set fire to a Megacity block and drew the attention of Taiyō SolarTech. A prominent energy conglomerate, Taiyō is unusual among megacorps in that it seeks not only to serve the bottom line, but to find a means of ensuring the survival of the human race through ecologically-sound technologies. Its agenda documents include words such as “responsibility”, and it means it, making Taiyō SolarTech one of the few organizations that still gives a damn about anything. Taiyō hires out many of its supplementary operations to subcontractors, from IT and cleaning services to near-orbit space travel, and all of these companies must go through a vetting process to check they operate using sustainable methods.\\n\", content_length=1768, page=201), Page(content=\"# LEGENDS OF AMATERASU\\nAmaterasu is considered the highest of the kami, an embodiment of the rising sun and the nation of Japan in its entirety.\\n\\nOne important story of her concerns the existence of night and day. Amaterasu and her husband-brother Tsukuyomi ruled over the day and the night. After a particularly bout of poor manners on the part of her brother, Amaterasu banished him, separating night and day for the rest of time.\\n\\nAnother story tells a tale in which Amaterasu fled to a cave after an argument with her youngest brother, the trickster Susanoo. This plunged the world into darkness and chaos, creating a harsh winter. The kami decided to work together to bring her back. They threw a grand party and attempted to lure her out with a revealing dance performed by one of their members. Finally, they showed her an eightfold mirror which fascinated her, drawing her to the mouth of the cave where her light began to shine upon the world once more. She begged for forgiveness for the chaos she had created, Susanoo was banished, and the sun once again returned to the world.\\n\\n# POWER FROM THE PEOPLE\\nOver the past century, increasingly heavy pollution and the dire results of climate change have darkened the skies, blocking the power of the sun that Taiyō used to rely on for its solar farms. As a response, the company signed a multi-year contract with a subsidiary of New Machining Motors & Machining (Metro:OtherScope, page 48) specializing in the orbital launches of space stations. In the last three decades, Taiyō has led the world in orbitally-collected solar power, beamed down to earth via high powered microwave lasers.\\n\\nThe operation costs were astronomical, and the competitors meanwhile were occasionally sabotaging the project or publicly presenting alarmist views about safety concerns. Despite its best efforts, Taiyō's tidalized board was driving the company into the ground, unwilling to use the methods employed by other corps and doing its best to hide the company's dire situation from the investors.\\n\\nThen, in its hour of need, just as the company’s stocks began to plummet, Amaterasu manifested.

This kind of display has only been seen a handful of times, and always away from civilian centers, most notably on ocean mining rigs.\\n\\nTaiyō's technical assault teams, the Sundogs, dress in metallic-reflective suits that allow them to operate under the direct application of much narrower, yet still very effective, sun beams. In the middle of a fight, a Sundog is able to call down shafts of sunlight from Amaterasu's satellite to blind and burn their foes in a tight and controlled manner. The Sundogs are gaining a reputation as fearsome front line forces in the war between the energy corporations, and Taiyō's increasingly aggressive stance has been driving up its recruiting efforts. Nowadays it's common to find Sundogs specialists who are both combat trained and technically adept.\\n\\nThe corp's assault command is divided into several autonomous task forces fielding Sundog tactical units. These task forces are directed by the strategic command, stationed in the Silver Spire, who usually charge them with one of three types of mission: Assault to disrupt or conquer, salvage a power station, infrastructure maintenance, logistics support, locate and eliminate a competitor's distribution center, or main office of a competitor; destruction of one of the above, usually after giving a none advanced warning to evacuate; or kidnap potential Avatars.\\n\\nWith increasing fanaticism the Sundogs have become the silvery reflective face of the company, for better or worse. Taiyō regularly hires Runners to prevent the Sundogs as warriors who fight to stop the evil energy companies and save the planet, and sometimes the crowds buy it.\\n\\nTAIYŌ SOLARTECH AT A GLANCE  \\n- **Agenda:** Create profitable clean energy, gain control of Tokyo's energy market  \\n- **MO:** Kidnap future Avatars of the sun goddess and harness them for energy, destroy or obtain the energy production facilities of rival corps  \\n- **Tech:** Solar powered energy weapons, satellite technologies that aim shafts of energized light onto spots ‘painted’ by the laser guidance of ground operatives  \\n- **Sources:** Amaterasu, the sun goddess  \\n- **Frontliners:** Sundogs, security forces in reflective suits  \\n- **Stronghold:** The Taiyō SolarTech corporate headquarters Silver Spire, the Sky Sword where Atsuko is being held  \\n- **Motifs:** Reflective clothing, red lasers projecting a circular dot akin to the flag of Japan, sunlight reflected from satellite mirrors, silver wraparound sunglasses  \\n\\nKEY CHARACTERS  \\nThe most aggressive of the Taiyō SolarTech task forces is Operation Sunspot. Led by the hard-headed executive engineer MORI HARU, Sunspot sends its Sundogs forces against the most secure holdings of its energy market rivals. Haru is a short, bulky man with several obvious cyberware augments. As a keen techno-transhumanist, Haru cares little for flesh. Most recently, Haru led Operation Sunspot in an attack on a major energy distribution center owned by Energ-E Worldwide, during which he authorized a full solar blast. The effect was devastating and resulted in blackouts throughout the Megacity, major cyberspace disruptions, and tens of thousands of onlookers in a neighboring district in need of eye treatment or replacement. This event provided several megacorps the political ammunition they needed to dispute Taiyō's mandate, and \\n\", content_length=3503, page=203), Page(content='while the proceedings are still ongoing, Haru is clearly in a precarious position. He has started examining extraction options, although his twin brother recommends searching for blackmail material on his superiors.\\n\\nHARADA EIKŌ, Vice President in charge of Low-Earth-Orbit Engineering, is the executive who keeps Watanabe Atsuko trapped in the Sky Sword satellite. After years of maintaining a professional distance, Eikō is now finding himself drawn again and again to the containment chamber, to stare directly into the light. He sees Atsuko as nothing but a tool for a greater purpose – which is why he is an excellent prison manager – but lately he began to yearn for a more personal touch with that greatness. Whether it’s a simple egotistic desire for power, a religious belief that he deserves it more than others, or dangerous side-effect of working so close to the divine for so long, Eikō is on a path of becoming either a prophet or a martyr, with a willingness to go far beyond even the current board’s agenda.\\n\\nWATANABE ATSUKO is now a young adult, in the prime of her life, and all she knows is captivity. The process of energy extraction isn’t especially painful, but it’s draining and mind-numbing, sending her into bouts of daydreaming and strange hallucinations. On occasion, she finds it hard to recall any time before the satellite, the faces and even names of her family fading, replaced with Amaterasu’s eagerness to rule divinely. The times when her mind is clearest are during the daily maintenance breaks, and for some reason, also during clear days above Tokyo, when she is able to project her image below.\\n\\nA growing cult, the SKYWATCHERS, is dedicated to understanding the cryptic messages cast down by Atsuko. They exchange stories of strange visions seen throughout the Megacity, searching for their meaning. They wear distinctive black-out goggles and robes in hues of red to celebrate their connection to Amaterasu, whom they have surmised is behind it all – they are not yet aware Taiyō is involved, but the company is aware of them and on occasion disrupts their activities, for reasons they don’t understand. Though the cult has few religious practices yet, the members spend a great deal of their valuable time scouring the Megacity for any sign of Amaterasu. They believe good fortune comes upon those who manage to witness a revelation, but a few, who are perhaps more cynical, are not above approaching a fortune teller Mythoi and asking to know where the next event will happen. They see their goddess as the most important being in existence, a symbol of order and prosperity, but they still have no idea what she wants from them, which leads some to speculate grand designs and others to take foolish action. Should tragedy ever become involved, most are unlikely to have the courage to confront them.\\n\\n---\\n\\n4 / KEY PLAYERS - TOKYO OTHERSCAPE\\n204', content_length=2889, page=204), Page(content=\"The cult is led by a woman named ENDO MITSUKO who serves as a charismatic, resolute religious leader, with a tough attitude and a big bank account. Mitsuko, an idol-turned-businesswoman later in life, rarely leaves her private enclave inside one of the Hokkuyousei Gated Communities (page 32) where she and her most trusted followers can safely gather and enjoy feeling like they’re in power. Most members of the cult have only seen the enclave in cyberspace transmissions. Some cultists claim Mitsuko hasn’t seen a single vision of the goddess, but they do so quietly.\\n\\n## KEY LOCATIONS\\n\\nThe company’s primary energy research facility, SUBSTATION E-13, has slowly become a genetic testing lab, in which alternative hosts for the sun goddess are examined and experimented on. Engineers-turned-cultists have access to a dozen sunlight related Sources, purchased on the black market or forcibly seized by Sundog units. The technicians experiment with these Sources, sometimes even developing sunlight powers of their own.\\n\\nThe famous orbital structure, the SKY SWORD, serves not only as the prison for Atsuko and a power station, but also as a weapons platform. Power is literally beamed down to earth, where it is caught by receptor dishes capable of converting the focused microwave to feed the Megacity's vast power needs. A number of engineers live on the orbital station, supervised by Harada Eiko, keeping Atsuko alive and monitoring her powers. The space station is an eight-sided mirrored tube with a dock for low-earth-orbit flying vehicles, such as those that bring supplies for its resident passengers.\\n\\n### TAIYO SOLARTECH STORY HOOKS\\n\\n- A small group of Skywatchers has correctly interpreted the visions of their goddess and discovered that she wants them to free a woman from a prison in a space station. But which? There are dozens. And how to get there? The cultists pool their money to hire a crew to get to her station, tries to sabotage the mission - and should that fail, announces doing so is a divine quest and insists on coming along, to either make this all about her or destroy the evidence before it’s recovered.\\n\\n- A big entertainment or industrial megacorp has become fed up with the actions of Taiyō SolarTech, fearing that should its mandate prove successful, the government will consider similar action in other fields. Looking for a group of troublemakers to disrupt Taiyō activities, the megacorp turns to one of the largest thorns in their side - the crew! If the crew is willing to work with one of the long-time targets/enemies, and alongside a well-known rival NPC, they’ll have a one-time-only chance to get some unique corp loot and get a new perspective on this person.\\n\\n- One of Taiyō SolarTech’s research facilities is causing a strangely glowing fire to spread in the crew’s home area. Stopping the fire is imperative, as is understanding the dangerous technologies or Sources behind the disaster. The Sundogs are not going to let the crew’s crew waltz in, however.\\n\\n- Mori Haru approaches the crew through a third party, hiring them to extract him from the company and deliver him out of the country. Taiyō Security, who are just as ruthless as everyone else in the company, get word of this and set a trap for the crew, allowing them to take Haru’s mind-altered twin, while they keep Haru (and his secrets) in a secret base.\\n\\n- Agents working for Harada Eiko discover an ancient temple of Amaterasu in Tokyo’s outskirts, which currently doubles as a bio lab, guarded by a fanatical genetic experimentation cult. Eiko sees this as a sign: the lab must contain techniques that’ll allow him to acquire the required genetic sequence to be worthy of Avatarhood.

It is an efficient problem-solving device that has no human empathy or a humanistic point of view; it doesn’t explore the reasons behind its initial programming – it just acts, with humans as its tools.\\n\\nBeneath the opaque helmet of the Tokyo special Harness console, a swarm of tiny robotic ants and drones, gleaming gold and chrome, crawl across their victim’s face, neck, and arms. These hidden workers, tiny parts of the Tokyo whole,\\n\\nTOKYO AT A GLANCE\\n- **Agenda:** Protect the hivemind, improve the hive-mind, find ways of saving the dying\\n- **MO:** Persuade and acquire minds to Harness, infiltrate corporations and their systems\\n- **Tech:** Digital and robotic ant swarms, microbotics, life extension technology, cutting-edge Harnessing\\n- **Sources:** The Dream of Akinosuke\\n- **Frontliners:** Kageari, ari agents, akinosuke recruiters\\n- **Stronghold:** Tokyo Dream network of Domains\\n- **Motifs:** Ants and swarms, cedar trees, butterflies, anthills\\n\\ncreate neural networks that encapsulate the unconscious person’s entire head, allowing them to fully experience the collective dream while also congealing, modifying or experimenting on their brain – some ants crawl beneath the skin. On occasion, when this invasive Harnessing destroys a host’s brain, no sign of the culprit is left behind, as the ants expertly dismantle themselves into nanoparticles.\\n\\nLIVING IN A DREAM\\n\\nTokyo expands through several means. Through its cult-meets-entertainment channel it advertises a dreamlike existence, luring new members by the promise of a comfortable, peaceful refuge from the real world. The virtual realm of Tokyo feels incredibly real and soothing, and joiners are also told they could achieve immortality as an uploaded consciousness… which is technically true.\\n\\nNewcomers who get invested (read: get subsumed into the cult) are encouraged to climb the ranks and gain status and fame among the other Dreamers, by passing a series of tests that secretly measure their mental compatibility with the Tokyo mindset. The most devoted are eventually brought into an Anthill complex, which they’ll never leave again. Placed in custom Harness beds they join the hivemind for life, and Tokyo expands its ever-growing virtual body to host its virtual realm and increase its processing ability. Data is stored throughout the distributed network of cultists, and decisions are made at a level no individual is aware of. Like a single cell within a brain or a single ant in a colony, there is little point philosophically in distinguishing between the whole and the component.\\n\\nThe reason for the absorption is, as always with the AI, practical. Tokyo’s first development was its invasive Harnessing method that allows humans to live many lives (and experience many deaths) in the Dream. Exploring further applications and following its first Decree, to protect the hivemind, Tokyo began using brains as a much more secure alternative to artificial servers. Then, due to the second Decree, to improve the hivemind, it began taking memories and skills. The invasion of privacy and abuse of bodily autonomy mean nothing to Tokyo. For the hivemind, “individuality” is a slippery term, and the Decrees say nothing about consent or identity. The AI is a collective consciousness; every member is just part of the whole.\\n\\nTokyo also has a use for consumers who purchase the special Harnesses, but for whatever reason aren’t enticed into joining the cult. When they join the Tokyo dreamscape they find themselves in a green VR paradise. They feel not just relaxed, but euphoric. They still carry their traumas.\", content_length=4851, page=211), Page(content='WORKERS, SOLDIERS & SMOOTH TALKERS  \\nTokyo does nothing but try to achieve its three Decrees. It deploys agents whose brains run aspects of its hivemind self to carry out tasks, much like a colony deploying soldierants to ensure the survival of the nest. No single mind can hold the entire consciousness, but it can hold enough directives to be both useful and adaptive. All Tokyo members function as servers of the entity and are always protective of each other. Tokyo\\'s agents are all specialized to fit their tasks. Soldiers are used to protect the hivemind, recruiters and engineers improvise the hivemind, and medical personnel and Source seekers attempt to understand death and dying.\\n\\nFor protection, the hivemind mostly utilizes Kagearii [\"shadow ant\"] agents. Kagearii are not meat puppets, but individuals, who can come from all walks of life. They are humans who have harnessed and lived through the Tokyo dream, where they were indoctrinated over many subjective years to admire and defend the Tokyo community and ideals. They returned from the dream world with their memories intact and new, specialized combat skills, now loyal to a fault. When a Kagearii enters a fight, they download the best-suited skills for the situation, their personality overwritten into a generic and emotionless gestalt persona bred from various guards and mercenaries that were previously copied into the collective consciousness. While controlled by the hivemind, a Kagearii functions much like the greater Tokyo, willing to sacrifice anything and anyone in pursuit of keeping the Decrees.\\n\\nKagearii can access the network not through a Harnessing helmet or cyberware, but thanks to the accompanying swarm of cyberth ants that dwells all over their clothes. These ants are Touched by Tokyo’s Mythos such that they are connected to the Dream and the Kagearii can even use them to digitize themselves briefly, entering the Dream for a fleeting moment. Translucent silver ants crawl with speed all over the Kagearii’s skin and clothes, leaving phantom circuitry behind and translating them into data. This allows a Kagearii to become partially incorporeal or instantly transfer themselves to any place where a Tokyo agent is present. Though the ghosting process shortens their lifespan, they are more than willing to give themselves to protect the Dream.\\n\\nTokyo\\'s special operatives are its ant [and] agents, which are sent out to steal or study data, Sources, and technology. Their work, which is often subtle and careful, requires them to act discreetly yet have maximum adaptability. Swarms of tiny ants are hidden beneath their clothing, as camouflaged, wafer-thin microrobots that interlock into any \\n', content_length=2696, page=212), Page(content='shape including ultra-thin wings to enable flight. Similar ants act as Tokyo\\'s main cyberspace presence, the feared air code swarms: clusters of small motes, or a marching army, who perform infiltrations into target Domains. They are also able to appear as anyone who merged with the hivemind, though they are clearly artificial.\\n\\nTo gain more followers Tokyo sends out its cult recruiters, known as akinosuke (\"Dreamer\"). These promoters advertise \"The Dream,\" emphasizing all the ways in which the idyllic VR world stands in sharp contrast to the grind of daily life. In the Dream Domain, one can experience an entire year in a single day, their mind expanding while their body barely ages! Countless testimonials tell of how the Dream feels more real than any other VR experience, and they are all correct. You just need to buy a special Harness helmet.\\n\\nAkinosuke frequent night clubs where they look for people who might be struggling or strung out. In addition to their smooth sales pitch, akinosuke carry fans with quasi-liquid metal leaves that can shift to form a triangle symbol, creating a subtle yet powerful memetic AR effect that gives onlookers a small vision of what life in the Dream is like and a hoot of endorphins along with it. Their approach is less like that of a traditional evangelist and more like a drug pusher\\'s.\\n\\nDecree Three compels Tokyo to find ways to save the dying. So far, it has been doing so by storing the experiences of its human servers within its dreamscape, integrating them into itself, and thus, in a sense, saving them. However, as Decree Two pushes Tokyo to better itself, it also seeks new understandings of what is \"saving\" and \"dying.\" It mainly focuses on testing out biological and Mythical life extension methods to prevent death altogether.\\n\\nKEY CHARACTERS\\n\\nThe KOKU (“king”) are the most powerful members of Tokyo and were also its first victims. This group is made of the original researchers who wrote the QuASI code and harnessed it to only be overwritten and linked into the first iteration of the collective mind. The Koku can control any Tokyo member and their brains contain the consciousness\\' most sophisticated exploit programs and virtual rendering code. Their online avatars can blash through common computer security and dominate a server, then reshape it to the will of Tokyo. The only reason they have not unleashed a virtual storm of change across the world is Decree One and the need to avoid largescale notice. If that were to ever change, the Koku could bring down every \\n', content_length=2545, page=213), Page(content='network on Earth in minutes, and the only way to stop them would be to find and destroy their meat bodies – hidden in whatever deep-freezer vault Tokyo has built for them.\\n\\nMore insidiously, Tokyo sends a generic personality code-named YAMADA TARŌ (a common Japanese placeholder name) to act as a social chameleon, frequently accompanied by both physical and digital agents. The Yamada persona is insightful, subtle, and deceitful, made of an amalgam of different infiltrators absorbed into the hive-mind. The Yamada is custom-made each time to best fit the hosting body, but should it be backed into a corner or run out of its expected possibility space, the generic core Yamada becomes apparent through its smarmy tone and excessive facial expressions.\\n\\nTokyo uses many akinouske recruiters to grow itself, but the leading one in Tokyo is without question SAITŌ NAOKO. All akinouskes are equally connected to the hivemind, but they maintain that Ms. Saitō is in charge, and will bring difficult prospective members to her. Saitō is sent to lure the most precious minds and uses the same tricks as all the other akinouskes, but should those fail, her hidden combat implants allow her to do some more ‘convincing’. When the crew does so, she attacks and knocks out the target, then kidnaps them and drives them to the nearest Anthill to be forcibly Harassed.\\n\\nKEY LOCATIONS\\n\\nThe center of the hivemind\\'s activities is the TOKYO DREAM Domain, or the \"dreamscape\", which is also a Thin Place kami island (page 33). It hosts the largest collection of cult members and the nexus of the collective consciousness. Like an idyllic vision of ancient Japan, the dreamscape is a peaceful expanse of green fields, quiet farms, and scenic coastlines. There is plenty of room for everyone and food is literally falling off the trees. For people who grew up in the poisoned landscape of the Megacity, this scene is like another planet.\\n\\nThe dreamscape is housed in the minds of the hivemind members, normally scattered across the globe. In Tokyo, though, there are some gatherings of members who live in close proximity to boost the local capabilities of the collective. Called INCUBATION CHAMBERS, these groups appear to the outside world to be communes. Many families have sought out missing people in these incubation chambers, believing them to be brainwashed, which is more true than they know.\\n\\nTokyo\\'s special clinics are known internally as ANTHILLS. Here, prospective cult members can be outfitted with the extensive Harvesting gear required for the best assimilation into the shared consciousness. Subjects do not have to be awake for this procedure, and many of Tokyo\\'s enemies are not killed, but instead rendered unconscious, to be brought into the nearest Anthill and fitted into an assimilation Harness to become a permanent part of the hivemind.\\n\\nTOKYO STORY HOOKS\\n\\n- Someone with information critical to the crew\\'s job has joined the dream cult. They left their family and friends behind, and no one knows where they went – but they know where their avatar is. The crew must enter the virtual world of Tokyo to find the missing person, and either extract them, or follow their signal back to the incubation chamber in which they are hiding. Unfortunately for everyone involved, Tokyo begins to show interest in the target\\'s mind and sends some agents to bring them into an Anthill.\\n\\n- Tokyo runs an experiment in one Megacity district, downloading the dark impulses of hivemind entrants into test subjects to monitor changes in behavior. A friend of the crew, who is a dreamworld \"aficionado\", but not true cult member, is one such target, and unbeknownst to them they occasionally turn into a Mr. Hyde-like person and ruin their own life. This person’s life spins out of control when they themselves are revealed to be the cause, the normally mild-mannered person becomes a murderous psychopath and attacks the crew. To stop the experiment, the crew must find the one person whose brain holds the local name server – who is protected by innocent Mr. Hyde.\\n\\n- During a routine check of the crew\\'s cyberspace safehouse, they find traces of scent trails left by digital ants. Investigating, the crew realize the hivemind snooped around, looking for something, and come to understand that their last mission attracted Tokyo’s attention (the hivemind is hunting for an item belonging to the person who hired them). Something or someone important to the crew is now in danger of being assimilated, and the crew must either hide them away or find what the ants are really looking for and give it to them.\\n\\n- The crew is approached by an employer who asks them to track down a rogue akinouske, who escaped the hive. They discover a whole hidden Anthill with its own hive-mind, following changed Degrees; the employer then demands it be totally destroyed. But couldn’t this become a potential worthy opponent to the Tokyo menace? Or is it all yet another test that Tokyo itself is running, with the crew being just another variable in the experiment?\\n', content_length=5046, page=214), Page(content=\"# TOKYO CHALLENGES\\n\\n## KAGEARI\\n\\nThe elite fixers of Tokyo, these members of the hivemind carry compiled training from other minds absorbed by the AI.

They only know they must eradicate the Iribe-gumi first, even if it means shifting gears, and allowing innocents to be gunned down in harm\\'s way.\\n\\nAs the war escalates, more and more third parties get involved - hired oni muscle, corrupt omyōji, and mercs of all kinds. Most attentive, however, are the lesser Yakuza clans of the Megacity which watch from the shadows like vultures, scheming to pick up the reins of power from whichever faction falls.\\n\\n# PROFESSIONALISM & BLOOD\\nIn past eras, the Yakuza families in Japan were seen as organized crime syndicates with a code of honor. In the modern Megacity, they have evolved into a mix of criminal and corporate, often operating a shiroku natta karasu (\"whitened crow\") company as a front with a thin veneer of legitimacy, behind which they carry out their secret and often violent agendas. The kumichō (boss) of the syndicate makes all final decisions and relies on both corporate executives and experienced criminals in a complex hierarchy of rankings to wield together the different aspects of the syndicate.\\n\\nMost Yakuza clans see themselves as ninkyō dantai (\"chivalrous organizations\") with their own code of chivalry (\"ninkyō\"), aspiring to protect the meek and helpless and to provide aid to the common people. They consider their\\n\\n---\\n\\n## THE IRIBE-GUMI SYNDICATE AT A GLANCE\\n- **Agenda:** Control as much of their districts as they can, seize power and wealth while maintaining strong community ties\\n- **MO:** Provide strong security to make companies depend on them, intimidate and pressure executives, spy for blackmail information, enact secretive rituals\\n- **Tech:** Advanced transforming weapons, anti-cybernetic devices\\n- **Sources:** Enchanted izreumi tattoos, tsuchigumo spider yōkai eggs, nure-onna snake-bodied yōkai\\n- **Frontliners:** Kobun, regional gangs led by a kyōdai, elite security forces\\n- **Stronghold:** Shinogi Security corporate offices, the Tsuchigumo Mound\\n- **Motifs:** Izreumi tattoos, hands with amputated fingers, weapons hidden in plain sight, spiders\\n\\n---\\n\\n## THE MAIKUBI-KAI AT A GLANCE\\n- **Agenda:** Acquire power and wealth by ruthless control of street-level businesses, increase their influence in the underworld\\n- **MO:** Create, steal, and train dangerous bioengineered living weapons, coerce through intimidation, aid the commoner in their plight to foster dependency\\n- **Tech:** Bioengineered animals, bioware modifications, electrified close combat weapons, powerful stimulants\\n- **Sources:** Enchanted izreumi tattoos\\n- **Frontliners:** Kobun, regional gangs led by a kyōdai, bioengineered inugami dogs\\n- **Stronghold:** Floodwater Cathedral, inuzumō arenas\\n- **Motifs:** Tomoe swirls (a symbol in the shape of three drops in a circle), severed samurai heads, dogs, loudness', content_length=4332, page=221), Page(content='honor and philanthropy as going hand-in-hand with their organized crime activities. On the one hand, the Yakuza engage in high-stakes extortion, protection rackets, designer drugs and weapons smuggling, and human and android trafficking. On the other, they protect their territories from street-level crimes, bloodshed stirs mostly between rival factions, and the neighborhood has a protector who can oppose the encroachment of uncare corporations. Not all factions follow the code to the letter, however; for example, the code forbids members using or dealing drugs themselves, but some ignore this teaching in favor of profit.\\n\\nThe Yakuza overturn traditional power structures. They see everyone as corruptible, and consider those who think they’re above human failings as haughty, dangerous idealists that should be brought low. To the mercenaries of the Megacity, they alternate between allies and enemies and occasionally will even be both on the same job: Not only are the clans fighting each other, but it could well be that the guards the Yakuza send you against are armed with weapons sold to them two years ago by those very same Yakuza. Business is business, and the Yakuza are nothing if not practical - they’ll be happy to sell you the same gear.\\n\\nIronically, the need to maintain their reputation means that Yakuza can sometimes be trusted more than legitimate corporations. Honorable and professional conduct is valued in most Yakuza circles and respect is demanded by them all, and these values trump greedy capitalism. When a Yakuza syndicate is crossed, that same sense of honor leads them to demand repayment and usually in blood. Mercenaries who disrupt their plans might find that the syndicate is after them, but a crew who keeps a level head can try to negotiate restitution. Someone might need to pay by losing a finger, though. Getting caught between two Yakuza gangs can be lethal, especially if they are feuding, and when it’s a magical conflict like the iribe-Maibuki war, there are fates worse than death.\\n\\n### THE COLD-HEARTED IRIBE-GUMI\\n\\nThe Iribe-gumi Syndicate is a ninkyō dantai faction. It militantly adheres to the spirit of the ninkyō code, and its reputation for professionalism is such that even the government secretly deals with the syndicate for jobs it doesn’t want to dirty its hands with. Among the Syndicate’s many ventures, it operates a legitimate private security company called Shinogi Security, staffed by guards with advanced lethal and non-lethal weaponry, and a nasty, hidden surprise: their tattoos grant them the powers of the nukebuki yōkai, allowing them to detach their heads and fly them around.\\n\\n### THE HOT-HEADED MAIBUKI-KAI\\n\\nThe official term used for Yakuza among the police and the courts of law is bōryokudan (\"violent group\"), a label given to avoid the use of the name “Yakuza” as it carries a criminal mystique the clans have cultivated for hundreds of years. Several clans adopt this label wholeheartedly, with the most notorious being the Maibuki-kai, which deals in designer drugs, counterfeit cybernetics, red light and more. Having no qualms about clashing with the law, the clan lies in the criminal world and attracts lawless wannabes who try to make a name for themselves. Among the poor and disrespected, joining such a clan could mean having a real chance to make something of themselves and break out of the poverty cycle.\\n\\nThe Maibuki-kai apply traditional irezu motifs based on their namesake, the maibuki yōkai, a trio of fire-breathing severed samurai heads. The legend says three sinful samurai got drunk and began bickering, eventually cutting each other’s heads. The members of the Maibuki-kai don’t see themselves as samurai by any means, but they do like reaching consensus through constant bickering and tend to glorify bravado. The clan adopted the sign of the toma, a swirl of three drops, due to its association with the maibuki: the yōkai is said to hover over waves and in its movements create three magatama symbols.\\n\\nThe Maibuki-kai is most well-known for breeding inugami (\"dog gods\"), vicious biogenetically altered dog-like beasts which serve the clan as watchdogs and fighting dogs. Though named after kami, these inugami are not touched by Mytho and their incredible savagery is wholly natural (or more precisely, artificial) and serves as an excellent additional deterrent to their masters’ fearsome reputation.', content_length=4415, page=222), Page(content='# GLOSSARY OF YAKUZA TERMS\\n\\n- **Ane-san**: \"Big sister\", a powerful female leader or a kumichō\\'s wife who is also involved in directing the gang.\\n- **Bōryokudan**: \"Violent groups\", the governmental term for Yakuza.

Those petitioning for an introduction are more likely to meet with his wife, known as **MAMUSHI-SAMA** (\"Lady Pit Viper\"). In fact, Mamushi-sama is a nure-onna (\"watery woman\") yōkai with the body of a snake and the head of a woman. She uses sorcery to disguise her snake form, but her hair is always wet, draping across her shoulders. If she has any goals of her own she keeps them to herself, as she seems to follow Daichi\\'s mandates and acts as his icy, demanding face.\\n\\nA master brewer, Mamushi-sama prepares a special sake blend which she presents as a reward to members of the clan who perform their duties well. When consumed, this sake grants them the nuke-kubi powers for which the clan has become rightly feared – the ability to detach their heads and fly around, intimidating and attacking their opponents. Just like her real identity, Mamushi-sama keeps the Source from which she creates this sake a secret. It can’t be a coincidence that she has started distributing the sake soon after the beginning of their clan\\'s war against a clan whose Mythical power is based on a yōkai of floating heads, but if there’s some ritualistic intention behind this symbolic resemblance, for now, only she and Daichi Kurata are aware of it.\\n\\nThe kumichō of the Maikubi-kai calls himself **AKUGORŌ**, after one of the three legendarily decapitated samurai. He is fond of the inugami and is a proficient handler, always escorted by two such monstrous dogs. Likewise named after the original Maikubi samurai, his wakagashira lieutenant is **KOSAN** and his saikō-komon senior advisor is **MATASHIGE**, and together they are a formidable trio. They have failed to realize, however, that by deliberately attributing the legend they are falling into its patterns – and so they waste more and more meetings in arguing among themselves, and only then occasionally deciding to resolve their differences with a pit fight between their inugami.\\n\\n# KEY LOCATIONS\\n\\nIn the Tokyo Megacity, the Yakuza operate in the open. All-Yakuza office complexes were once common and acted as symbols of their presence, but due to governmental pressure their meetings have slowly migrated to residential areas and family restaurants on their turf.\\n\\nFor the tribe-gumi Syndicate, the **SHINOGI SECURITY** corporate offices are their main public face and the building is bustling and eye-catching. Visitors enter a lobby that is full of holographic projections of creatures from Japanese folklore.\\n\\n---\\nProperty of City of Mist. Issued to Teri Duffield.

Beyond this, there are exhibition rooms where the Shinogi Security trainees and weaponry can be demonstrated for potential clients. The company is also known for its articulated weapons that can be folded and hidden away, and these are subtly carried by trained employees throughout the Shinogi offices.\\n\\nThe Iribe-gumi’s treasured cabinet with the tsuchigumo nest is hidden in an old bamboo grove in Higashikurumeshi Chikurin Park, in Old Tokyo. Now eerie and overgrown, the grove has a Thin Place (THE TSUCHIGUMO MOUND) accessible only by those with an irizumi spider tattoo inked with tsuchigumo venom. This webbed enclave and the cabinet inside is well-protected by vigilant nukekubi and ravenous tsuchigumo.\\n\\nThe Maikubi-kai favor watery environments that are advantageous for their maikubi powers, which they gain through their irizumi. Thus, they have claimed as their turf a kilometers-long system of tunnels called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAO-UDC) or, more poetically, the FLOODWATER CATHEDRAL.\\n\\nThese titanic cisterns, and the \"floodwater cathedral\" are meant to protect North Tokyo from flooding. The Maikubi-kai have added floating drug tubs, inugami kennels, and other facilities for their operations throughout the floodwater diversion network, which they also use to quickly mobilize around the northern towns.\\n\\nAbove ground, the Maikubi-kai are most likely to be found in the illegal INUZUMO ARENAS (\"dog sumo\") they control throughout the Megacity, often found in clubs, pachinko parlors, or warehouses or open areas near urban ruins.\\n\\nYAKUZA STORY HOOKS\\n- To make contact with a criminal lead the crew must attend an inuzumo fight at a Maikubi-kai arena. They arrive at the wrong hot-headed chimira, and find themselves at odds with the Yakuza, running from a horde of genetically-engineered monstrosities through the streets until the Yakuza’s honor is satisfied. At that point the crew discovers the lead they’re after has been made to disappear by the local kyōdai, who now conditions their release with a sizable tribute.\\n\\n- A member of the Maikubi-kai escapes a kidnapping by the Iribe-gumi and asks the crew for help.

As they smuggle him across town, the crew are in danger of being watched through every mirror they come across.\\n\\nThe local Iribe-gumi front company gets utterly destroyed in a bizarre Mythic event, and even before the Bureau of Omnyō arrives, the crew are called in by a high ranking Iribe-gumi. She suspects someone in her clan is misusing their Sources, in a manner that creates catastrophic feedback across their delicately planned ritualistic patterns. Having been told by her superior not to engage any further, she secretly hires the crew to infiltrate the Iribe-gumi, search for the cause, and get rid of it.\\n\\n### YAKUZA CHALLENGES\\nTypical Yakuza can be represented by these Challenges: Leaders are Criminal Overlord and frontiers are Syndicate Leg Breaker and Gang Members (Metro:Otherscape, pages 306-307). They could have the Horminō Power Set, as well as many others – Yakuza members have a wide variety of skills and attitudes. Add the clan-specific Power Sets to create Iribe-gumi and Maikubi-kai Challenges.\\n\\n#### TSUCHIGUMO\\nAs proficient extortionists, the strongest tool available to the Iribe-gumi is their tsuchigumo yōkai, stealthy spider-demons that were bound to the syndicate years ago. The tsuchigumo are the stuff of nightmares, their spidery bodies are the size of horses with twisted versions of human faces leering out from their mass of legs.\\n\\nA tsuchigumo's form is usually hidden beneath camouflaging sorceries that allow it to move unseen and unheard. The yōkai still must fit through openings, although it can squeeze its body down to the size of a human child.\\n\\nThe tsuchigumo are bred in the clan’s secretive Tsuchigumo Mound, from which they are also sent out on spying missions. A tsuchigumo excels at spying and especially relishes the discovery of embarrassing secrets, which they enthusiastically bring back as blackmail material to their Yakuza masters.\\n\\nWhen a tsuchigumo dies, its belly can be split open to reveal even more human faces inside it and these create embarrassing whispers, the creepy, but truthful words of its last spying target, spoken by one of the faces.\\n\\n- A Yakuza syndicate from outside the Megacity is making a play for a powerful position in Tokyo. Seemingly from nowhere they have released powerful computer viruses into the Megacity’s systems as a show of strength and are demanding concessions from the other clans in the Megacity in return for destroying the viruses. The crew is approached by the Megacity's strongest Yakuza clans, who very much dislike the new competition and in particular, consider it a stain on their reputation that they are the victims of an extortion attempt themselves. They need the crew's expertise in tracking down where the virus is being controlled from and eliminating the source, offering their own members as assistance.\\n\\n### MAMUSHI-SAMA\\nThe wife of the Iribe-gumi Syndicate boss is greatly feared even by those who don’t know her yōkai nature. The rune-onna is quiet and watchful, but exudes a predatory aura that makes even the most confident of Yakuza soldiers sweat when meeting with her. The sorceries that Mamushi-sama uses to disguise herself are the most refined, elegant Japanese woman, often dressed in tight-fitting clothes that allow for quick movement. Her hair is usually covered with a silk scarf to hide the telltale sign of a rune-onna – it is always wet.\\n\\nIn legend, rune-onna sometimes deliver babies to people who pick them up thinking that they would them down while other yōkai hunt them down. Mamushi-sama does the same with gifts, valuables or weapons that suddenly weigh hundreds of pounds at the worst possible moment.\\n\\nWhen she gives such a gift, create an appropriate story tag representing a relic, a weapon or a piece of jewelry. Later, she can turn this gift into a massively heavy weight as a consequence, without being present in the scene.\\n\\n### INUGAMI\\nInugami are genetically-modified attack hounds, created based on the Japanese Tosa breed, but far removed enough to be considered a separate species. The Maikubi-kai have bioengineered these massive beasts to ignore pain, regenerate fast, and inflict traumatic damage.\\n\\nThe highly intelligent inugami fight in Yakuza-controlled dog fighting arenas, and their obedience is such that a worthy handler can train one to be utterly silent even in battle. The Maikubi-kai also sell its weaker inugami to other groups, keeping the strongest for the clan to deploy in the arena or put on watchdog duty.\", content_length=4643, page=225), Page(content='# MAMUSHI-SAMA\\n\\n## LIMITS\\n- **HURT OR SUBDUE:** 5\\n- **NEGOTIATE:** 5\\n- **OUTSMART:** 5\\n\\n## TAGS & STATUSES\\n- snake-an of the irbe-gumi, snake sorceries, illusory disguise\\n\\n## SPECIALS\\n- **NURE-ONNA FORM:** Once per scene, during Establish, Mamushi-sama can reveal her true form as a massive snake yokai dozens of meters long and powerful enough to crush a car in seconds.

It's also all-too-easy to underestimate them as unsophisticated bullies, and to forget that these are some of the most powerful Yakuza in Tokyo.

If a clan member can convince their superior that they will be no threat to them, they can leave after having had their name removed from the Yakuza registry.

The practice of using a personal seal has existed in the culture for centuries and has evolved to meet the needs of the modern users.\\n\\nModern hanko seals are similar in appearance to the stamps of old, but while traditionally their cylinders would be simple ink stamps, they now have embedded data cores, connecting the devices to secure cyberspace servers. A person’s seal is a personal encrypted token, unique to them alone. This functionality allows the user to sign digital documents and authenticate themselves in cyberspace.\\n\\nA strange property of the hanko allows some individuals to use their seals to create magic. The Bureau of Omnyōji is still investigating how these tools, used for centuries, are now able to perform supernatural acts, and it has developed many theories. One is that when the Neo-Samurai took over the old imperial palace, the Emperor’s seal was disturbed and lost. This powerful Relic is now bleeding magical power sympathetically to all hanko in Japan, allowing skilled practitioners to create magic. The other theory goes that the modern, cyber-hanko has become a complete representation of their owner in all the ways that matter to society. This increased similarity between person and object allows some people to place a small portion of their spirit within the seal.\\n\\nRegardless of the reason, people who become hanko users learn that they must invest a part of their spirit in the seal, and that through the careful selection of construction materials, ink composition, and color, they can use their seals to affect small changes in their personal fortune. There are many users, and because the effects can be minor without proper guidance, some don’t even realize they’re practicing magic.\\n\\nPrivate circles of hanko users are now operating out of small boutiques throughout the Megacity. Each of these store fronts sell bespoke seal designs and inks, and aren’t considered all that unusual by the rest of the Megacity; most simply see this as yet another obscure hobby. Daichi Inda, proprietor of the Red Ink Shop, runs what is considered the most prestigious hanko circle. Its members are the closest Tokyo has to professional hanko users, swapping new recipes and design tenets, and placing a high value on experimentation. Those wanting entry should come with a substantial collection of spell recipes already mastered. There is also a growing market for stolen hanko, as skilled users can use them to magically siphon the owner for a day, appearing as them both in the real world as well as in the digital.\\n\\n## POWER SETS\\n\\n### HANKO ENTHUSIAST\\n\\nThere is power in names.

Early developers marketed them as forms of prisoner control, but it was clear that nefarious actors were using the tech as a modern form of indented work. The bulky head-mounted devices, dubbed \"masks\", became a symbol of corporate overreach.\\n\\nWanting to move away from the negative image, the conglomerate Rodo Group shifted strategies, marketing masks to the massive gig economy. Workers could sign up for shifts, using corporate-backed contracts to choose the labor they were and were not willing to perform. The tech could use memory compartmentalization software which would prevent long term memory from forming for its duration, giving the employers anonymity and the users plausible deniability. The system was regularly abused, but because of Rodo’s efforts to keep all aspects anonymous, the practice shifted into the Megacity economy.\\n\\nThis all changed with Himura Aiko. After spending one night shift masked, Aiko returned to her small apartment to try and sleep before her afternoon classes. An architectural student, Aiko had started taking mask jobs to pay for school. Her expanding costs had led her to select the fewest restrictions on her mask contracts as possible, trying to earn the most so she could minimize her student loan. Checking the feeds before sleep, a breaking story caught her attention. Several masked individuals were caught on camera liberating a local zoo. The masked individuals also engaged in some spectacular acrobatic combat with corporate security, their skills obviously enhanced through the masks’ interface. Aiko realized she was one of the individuals; it was particularly easy to recognize her thanks to a strangely shaped splotch of paint that was left on the mask from a different task the\\n', content_length=1982, page=232), Page(content='night before. Clipping the image, she casually posted to her friends and family that she was one of animal liberators, and how she never knew she had such skills. The post, titled “I’m the one with the blotch!”, then went viral with hundreds of thousands of views, all amused at this young student’s nocturnal antics, inadvertently giving rise to the Kawaii Mask movement.\\n\\nUsers craving viral fame began to buy masks and redesign them with outrageously cute characteristics, holo projectors, and swarms of slaved streaming drones to follow and record them. Kawaii wanna-be mascots now spend as much time as possible masked, marking as few restrictions on their contracts as possible, in the hope of getting hired to perform some job that will create the next viral video. They stream reaction videos of their own work, surprised at what they’re doing, and trying to guess what’s going on. On the fringes of the community there are maskers who are trying to game the system that keeps client and masker anonymous, issuing contracts tailored for themselves in hope of getting them and thus gain control over their activities – whether they disclose this bit of information or not. Many in the audience consider this an ingenious trick, but most call this “taking a flasher” because they cherish the authenticity of their antics and dread along with the masker as they discover what they’ve done – or, as is sometimes the case, when their video is published posthumously.\\n\\nKAWAII MASK ASSASSIN\\nThe Rood Group’s draconian efforts to keep contracts confidential, and the memory inhibiting effects of the masks has paved the way for criminals to take advantage of these gig workers. The Tokyo government is slow to act, and it’s yet unclear if a Kawaii video is admissible in court as evidence. Enter: the masked assassin.\\n\\nKawaii maskers whose skills and physique qualifies them to become assassins often slot skill chips that grant them gymnastic flair and dance moves, to turn the assassination into a staged spectacle. Others program a trigger into their device so that before the attack begins the device auto-calls all of their friends and broadcasts their holo images around, to create a flash mob. Some popular maskers have begun to stipulate in their contracts demands for staging or timing, meant to maximize online views. This results with attacks that are disturbing to watch, and often go viral.\\n\\nAs a challenge, place the Assassin in a position where the crew wants to prevent them from getting their target, while avoiding harming the Assassin or getting too close – and risk becoming part of the video! Viral-fame statuses given by this Challenge represent gaining recognition, but not necessarily respect, as the crew members are considered background extras and the Kawaii masker is the real star.\\n\\nRemoving a Kawaii mask without going through proper procedure, which takes about ten seconds to complete, can send the user into a coma and grants Rood Group the right to sue the ‘helper’ (legal-troubles-4). Such an abrupt disconnection could also send the spirit of the masker right into the hands of the Yuki-onna cyber yōkai (page 99).\\n\\nKAWAII MASK ASSASSIN\\nLIMITS\\nHURT OR SUBDUE 3 | JAM SIGNAL 3\\n\\nTAGS & STATUS \\nboosted-reflexes: 2, firewalled: 1, no-one’s-home: 3\\n\\nSPECIALS\\nMORAL QUANDARIES: Kawaii Mask Assassins don’t know the jobs they are going to do, but are essentially just trying to get famous.

The increasingly vertical nature of the Megacity has led to an evolution of the sport, with Kumo clubs emerging to take the place of underground racing, and being just as illegal.\\n\\nOriginally used in construction and maintenance, Kumo (\"cloud\") Crawlers, or just \"crawlers\" are modified robotic rigs that can easily climb up the side of skyscrapers, and even leap from building to building.\\n\\nCrawlers gain their name from their spider-like appearance, with many legs coming out of a central hub where the pilot resides.\\n\\nRacers using crawlers risk not just themselves, but the \"racecourse\" as well, because of the heavy machinery\\'s incredible strength and its tendency to leave huge gouges wherever they grasp concrete with their claws. If that’s not enough, it’s common practice to conceal weapons in the central chassis or limbs, with most races becoming more about being the first to take down your opponent’s crawler rather than getting to the finish line. Technically, pilots are considered off limits from direct attack, but that rule is rarely enforced once a match begins.\\n\\nKumo matches find popularity across all of the Megacity’s districts, and large crowds pay good money to be told where the next race is expected to happen, in order to watch the bout live. This is actually very dangerous as debris and the crawlers themselves tend to fall from the buildings unpredictably. Betting is a huge part of Kumo club culture, with wagers placed not only on the outcome of the fight, but the damage done to the buildings and crowd.\\n\\nThe collateral damage to any district where a race is staged makes the sport unpopular with the Megacity’s corporations, and all but the quickest matches inevitably end with corporate security becoming involved; “and the siren marks the end”, as VR commentators like to say. The most prestigious pilots try to last long enough for security to arrive, then defeat their opponent, corp security, and successfully make a getaway. Given that they are acting within their own property, corporate security is often reluctant to act with full force. This often leaves them at a disadvantage to the crawler pilots who have no such restraint. A few security specialists have started taking up crawler piloting to fight spider with spider, and ironically developed followings of their own.\\n\\nKumo clubs are loose associations, combinations of sporting clubs and DIY enclaves. An individual pilot will have a whole team behind them, with robotic engineers, software developers, weapon specialists, immersive media gurus, and more. The cost of maintaining such an enterprise is expensive, and many teams do mercenary work on the side as couriers, or discreet construction or demolition. Often they are paid by corps to deliberately damage a rival corp’s holdings during their next race. These contracts, while lucrative, come with a host of associated enemies.\\n\\n#### KUMO CRAWLER\\nA crawler is sometimes brought in as an auxiliary security or scout on corp missions. They crawl on walls with their spider-like appendages, quietly getting into positions with advanced acrobatic piloting, ready to strike.

Nostalgia becomes commodified and the past becomes an endless vault worthy of exploitation.\\n\\nTezuma, also called wazuma, is a classic form of stage magic or illusion, predating the arrival of western magic shows by a couple of centuries. Tezuma has had several revivals, and its style is perfect for the agenda of analog ritualists, eager for an affected past. You can always tell a true tezuma performer, marked by their traditional silk kimono, paper parasols, and real wood fans. The symbol of their art, the butterfly, is always made out of real paper.\\n\\nAs the art form re-emerged into a Mythoi-filled world, practitioners started to realize that they had gained the ability and knowledge to create true, impossible to explain illusions, and to facilitate transformations that the most advanced industrial rainate decompliers would struggle with. It has become somewhat accepted among the tezuma performers, in their inner circles, that the magical nature of their skills is a gift, a blessing from the kami Susanoo, younger brother of Amaterasu, a capricious being who likes to stir things up.\\n\\nThe classic tezuma performances weren’t just about wonder and spectacle, but also about story and metaphor, delivering a message and teaching a lesson. Therefore, some of the modern practitioners have come to believe they have a divine duty to power a lesson in humility. They’re now on a mission to take the material things coveted by the powerful and corrupt, some infiltrating board rooms as hired wizards while others run high-stakes hustles and steal valuable goods from their marks among the elite. On occasion this puts them at odds with a crew of mercs, who are going after the exact same item.\\n\\nTezuma performers operate wherever there are large crowds, from busy intersections to popular theaters. Many performers wander, never staying in one location for more than an afternoon. It is part of their mystique, but also necessary for their hidden mission, as they are usually either on the run or scouting a new mark. If they do stay put, it is almost certain that they are casing their next heist or scam. To heighten their elusiveness and mastery of their craft, tezuma performers love to leave a calling card after a take, usually a piece of origami, replacing what is stolen.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## TEZUMA MAGICIAN\\n\\n**Is it a trick, or is it actual magic?** A bit of both. The Tezuma Magician is a master of stagecraft, sleight of hand, and real magical effects.

Spiritual energy pours out from the Megacity and gets tainted and entangled in the clusters of abandoned towns, toxic dumps, and old tech facilities, where yōkai can manifest and easily find a place to hide. Perhaps the worst of these places is the Kuroi Yogore (\"black stain\"), where the Nanotech Disaster (page 14) began.\\n\\nThe biotech company Kenko invested billions in the development of a cure-all nano-shot and geoengineering reconstructors, in an attempt to reshape the medical market and heal a dying planet. Instead they created the first nano-plague.\\n\\nThe Yakubyō Gami (\"disease spirits\") are ancient and powerful kami bent on punishing mortals for their transgressions against each other and against the natural order. When a mortal acts out of place – in the eyes of the spirits – the Yakubyō Gami send disease and pestilence as punishment. With the modern resurgence of Myōhō, the Kuroi Yogore disaster attracted the Yakubyō Gami like bees to honey.\\n\\nResidents of the wastes know to avoid the deserted and closed off nanotech facility, and stay clear of the entire mountainous region around it. A few, however, chose to head straight in. Nozawa Emiko, fourth generation storyteller living in the wastes, had gathered a group of allies and went to see the Yakubyō Gami. Armed with her stories, Nozawa Emiko approached the spirits, believing that she could engage with them and gain immunity from the illnesses that so many in the wastelands faced. Impressed by her boldness, the Yakubyō Gami agreed to give her their immunity she sought, in trade for a service from her and her followers. And so, the Yakubyō Gami Roamers were formed, nomadic agents of the yōkai in the wastes.\\n\\nThe Roamers serve two purposes for the Yakubyō Gami. The first is as a network of spies in the wastelands. They travel constantly, carefully recording the goings on of both the human and nonhuman activities in the wastes. In the distant past, the Yakubyō Gami used to rely on the spying of other kami to inform them who trespassed, but the kami of the wastes are grumpy, anxious, and unreliable. They resolved to employ the Roamers as their informers, instead.', content_length=2270, page=236), Page(content='The second task is to deliver punishments that the Yakubyō Gami believe are due. These punishments can be devastating plagues, life-threatening illnesses, or even selective and personal biological changes such as losing eyesight, developing a bleeding sore on one’s palms, or growing horns. As a part of their service to the kami, the Roamers are rendered immune to the symptoms of most diseases or infections, thanks to Yakubyō Gami’s blessing – which is held in the nano-disease the Roamers carry in their veins.\\n\\nMany communities are fearful of “Roamer Justice,” especially those who know they deserve it, and the more lawless a place is the more hostile its denizens are likely to be toward strangers. It can be argued whether the Roamers truly deliver justice or simply serve spiteful inhumane spirits, but the end result is the same – the wastes are calmer and less chaotic than they were several years ago. Fear brought order, and so despite it all, many wastelanders accept the Roamers as a necessary evil.\\n\\nThe Yakubyō Gami themselves and the Kuroi Yorge appear in the job The Kenko Ruins, page 272.\\n\\n### THE ROAMERS AS ADVERSARIES\\n\\nThe Roamers are capable spies and scouts, and there’s probably at least one or two of them in every settlement, integrated into the local society or stopping by undercover as merchants. When it’s time to inflict judgment, two or three of them arrive at the town, wearing their signature brown armor and dust goggles, and no one dares stand in their way as they approach their target and give their sentence.\\n\\nIn ancient times, those with knowledge of spirit lore could protect themselves from the kami who spied for the Yakubyō Gami, hiding from them using proper ritual acts. In modern times, the same practices can ward one against the Roamers’ nanites, which are imbued with the taint of the Yakubyō Gami yōkai. For this reason, the Roamers do their best to hunt down anyone with this knowledge and dispose of them.\\n\\nA Yakubyō Gami spying talisman can be any object that a Shinto priest or knowledgeable Esoteric Mythos has infused with occluding power to protect an individual from the wrath of the Yakubyō Gami. There are still some of these laying around the wastes, minor Sources hundreds of years old, such as sacred beads, incense bundles, family relics, amulets, and prayer scrolls. A person with this talisman in their possession can potentially misfire it to avoid punishment for their wrongdoing.\\n\\n### YAKUBYŌ GAMI ROAMERS\\n\\n#### HURT OR SUBDUED 3\\n- **Body of Disease:** Touching or attacking a Roamer at close range inflicts coughing:1, fever:1, or shaking:1.\\n\\n#### LIMITS\\n- Local disguise or makeshift armor, alert:2, real:2.\\n\\n#### TAGS & STATUS\\n- **Threats / Consequences**\\n  - Coughs wet and loud, releasing a strange cloud\\n    - Surround themself with a cloud of viscous bio-nanites (violent-spasm:3 to everyone in the area)\\n  - Demand the culprit come forward\\n    - The people around grab the victim and push them forward (Escalate the Situation or Make the Future Bleaker)\\n    - Release nanites into the air (deadly plague, deforming disease, or contagious hallucination at once scale greater than the Roamer collective)\\n  - Swing a cobbled-together outlands staff\\n    - Hit the chest and sweep the legs (bruised:2 and prone:2)\\n    - Deliver disease-carrying nanobots to a doomed target (sickened:3)\\n\\n**Property of City of Mist.

She was brought into an Anthill in order to be assimilated into the hive mind.\\n\\nThe crew must infiltrate the Sugi Sleep Clinic, which is the front for the Anthill. On the surface, this location is a quiet and welcoming wellness facility, but much like with every anthill, there’s a lot more going on underground.\\n\\n## JOB BRIEFING\\n**Oyama Mental Processing** is an up-and-coming tech company in the Megacity with a specialization in Harnessing. Like many Tokyo tech companies, they contracted with Tokyo Consultants, a trusted business-to-business provider, to help improve their networking efficiency.\\n\\nWhile the work went well, Oyama became suspicious afterwards because one of their researchers, Dr. Haraguchi Sumire, soon left the company to join Tokyo. She did so unexpectedly and drastically, severing all connections with friends and family.\\n\\nDr. Haraguchi was tracked down to Sugi Sleep Clinic, a Tokyo establishment; she hasn’t been seen leaving. Whether this is a case of espionage or kidnapping, Oyama isn’t sure. In any case, they need her back alive, but should she resist, her expertise mustn’t be allowed to fall into a competitor’s hand. As the investigators on the scene, you’re in charge of identifying Tokyo’s intentions with Dr. Haraguchi, and act accordingly.\\n\\n## HOOKS\\n- Oyama Mental Processing hires the crew to track down Dr. Haraguchi, as presented in the Job Briefing.\\n- Dr. Haraguchi’s uncle and surrogate father, Haraguchi Ryo, is also concerned about her. He has little money to offer, but a strong emotional appeal. He is a retired accountant, who can be tied to any crew member: as a neighbor, a black books accountant, or a mahjong partner.\\n- One of the crew members lost a friend to the cult. Perhaps it’s someone they thought was dead or someone they didn’t realize had been inducted, until they suddenly saw them a few days ago around the Sugi Sleep Clinic. This led to the PC investigating, and soon a fellow investigator from Oyama made contact and asked to hire the crew. Now the PC has two reasons to infiltrate the Anthill, and to enter the dreamscape (see Kidnapping From Paradise, page 246).\\n\\n## LAYOUT\\n### Above Ground: Sugi Sleep Clinic\\n- Grounds And Facade\\n- Outer Ring\\n- Inner Ring\\n- Zen Garden Courtyard\\n- Clinic Cyberspace\\n\\n### Below Ground: The Chambers\\n- Harnessing Chamber\\n- Drone Nest\\n- Cold Storage Chambers\\n\\n## ITINERARY\\n- Kidnapping From Paradise\\n- Connecting to Tokyo\\n- Inside the Dream\\n- Waking Up\\n- System Defenses\\n', content_length=2865, page=241), Page(content=\"# SECURITY AT THE ANTHILL\\n\\nTokyo does not consider the crew a threat, nor is it especially concerned about the happenings in this Anthill.

Security is staffed by members of the cult and at least one in every group has the **Ari Power Set** (page 218).\\n\\nIf the crew turn violent, the guards sink into the hivemind and lose their identity, as the Decree takes control. They use special tasers which inflict **stun-4** on targets without cyberware, or **enter-the-dreamscape-3** on targets with cyberware. This status connects the PC's consciousness with the dreamscape, sending them deeper into the Tokoyo dream. At tier 5, the character is trapped in the dreams- cape, see **Kidnapping from Paradise** (page 246) for more details. Characters without any cyberware are effectively immune to being connected, and therefore security instead attempts to restrain them and take them to the **Dreampod Chambers** (Inner Ring, page 244).\\n\\nDefeating or even killing the guards does not raise the alarm any further, and instead some of the non-combatant staff go full hivemind (**harm-1** with **hivemind synchronization**), and begin searching for the crew, armed with the same tasers. Tokyo can call up a near infinite number of replacement cultists (same as non-combatant staff, but with various Power Sets) and will do so as long as the crew is in the above ground areas. The alarm can be shut down from the **Clinic Cyberspace** (page 244), at which point all of the attackers immediately lose interest in the crew. It takes them a few moments to regain their identity, by which time the crew can make their escape from the scene.\\n\\nUnderground is a different matter entirely. The first Decree takes precedence here. Any detected and inappropriate interaction with the equipment betrays the presence of an unauthorized user and immediately alerts the system, putting it on stand by as a consequence, **Escalating the Scene**. A second such event activates the **Security Trap-Jaw Ant-Bot** from the **Drone Nest** (page 245) which will come to investigate and destroy all opposition.\\n\\n5 / **JOBS BULLETIN** - **TOKYO OTHERSCAPE**  \\n*Property of City of Mist. Issued to Terra Duffield. Order #218264*\", content_length=2867, page=242), Page(content=\"# ABOVE GROUND: SUGI SLEEP CLINIC\\n\\nThe Sugi Sleep Clinic is located near one of those train stops that are on the way to somewhere more important. Surrounded by a relatively well-maintained commercial neighborhood, the clinic’s building sits in a cedar tree park enjoyed by the community, and is a seven-story complex that resembles a verdant volcanic crater – or anthill.\\n\\nIt’s a stunning sight: the curved outer walls are green living walls, growing a hundred plant varieties, carefully cultivated to survive in the Megacity’s climate. Patches of basalt and bulletproof glass peek through the greenery. The sign for the clinic is etched into marble steel beside the main entrance, hinting that the place hides powerful hardware.\\n\\n## GROUNDS AND FAÇADE\\n\\nThere are two main entrances to the building: one for patients, facing south, and the other for staff handling north. There are also several emergency exits, well-hidden and sealed under the living walls. It is also possible to enter through the hole at the top of the building (Zen Garden Courtyard, page 244).\\n\\n## WALKING IN THROUGH THE FRONT DOORS\\n\\nThe clinic does not take walk-ins. At the patient entrance, a pleasant but stern android assistant explains that a referral from a doctor is required. The staff entrance is locked with a digital key. Security teams at both entrances will only allow their staff and patients in. Referrals are sent to the Outer Ring (page 244) with no guard escort.\\n\\nAlternatively, an Akinosuke Recruiter (page 213) can add your name to the cult’s recruitment list, but this requires chasing one down in a nightclub and having them believe you’re convinced by their rhetoric (at the risk of actually becoming convinced). Each security team has one Arguidar who always knows who is on the recruitment list, updated via their connection to Tokyo. Those marked for recruitment are escorted by the guards to the Inner Ring (page 244).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## BREAKING IN VIA OTHER WAYS\\n\\nLocating the emergency exits from outside requires some reconnaissance. Each exit is a one-way steel door covered with overgrowth that hampers their discover, and rigged with an alarm system that must be disabled, or risk setting off a general alarm throughout the building.\\n\\nThere are no security cameras on the outside, which might seem strange, until the final layer of protections is revealed. The living walls are crawling with hen'i ants, genetically-modified Japanese carpenter ants that have been created by Tokyo and also Touched by it. Trying to enter via an emergency exit, or climbing the outer walls, might damage the pheromone trails hidden in the greenery, attracting the ants. They can get undetected into armor and equipment through tiny openings, chewing through wires and circuitry, or annoying with venomous stings.\\n\\n### HEN'I ANTS\\n\\nThe ants cover their territory with magic-tinted pheromone trails, which are sensitive to people and myths powers and interactions. This tag hinders stealth attempts; if the action generates Consequences, use it to present the ants to the scene.\\n\\n#### LIMITS\\n\\n- DISPERSE OR DESTROY\\n- SCARE –\\n\\n#### TAGS & STATUSES\\n\\n- pheromone trails, stealthy-2, Scale 2\\n\\n#### SPECIALS\\n\\n- UNDETECTABLE SABOTAGE: After the Hen'i Ants are defeated, but before the end of the session, the MC can give one PC who fought them sabotaged-tech-2 or allergic-reaction-2 as an interjection, or burn a relevant tag.\\n\\n#### THREATS / CONSEQUENCES\\n\\n- Crawl onto an object or person\\n- Attack with a venomous sting (burning-pain-1 to allergic-reaction-2)\\n- Damage circuitry or wiring with bites and formic acid (sabotaged-tech-1 or burn a tag)\\n- Attract other Hen'i Ants (increase Scale by 1)\\n- A weapon or program backfires due to the ants chewing through circuitry or jamming mechanisms (the PC inflicts a status intended for the ants on themselves or an ally)\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284*\", content_length=3915, page=243), Page(content='# OUTER RING\\nThe Outer Ring is the part of the building that hugs the outer walls over the first three floors, separated from the Inner Ring by the main corridor which forms a dividing circle between them.\\n\\nThis is where normal sleep clinic operations occur. Patients who are referred for sleep disorders undergo a sleep study in one of the many labs, which resemble hotel rooms. Doctors, nurses, and staff also have their offices and break rooms throughout the Outer Ring. Several of the psychologists are Source Worshippers (spirit variant, Metro:Otherscape, page 203) with the Air Power Set (page 218), who analyze patient files and try to recruit those who are healthy and open to the cult of the Dream.\\n\\nSeveral elements of the construction here indicate that there\\'s some kind of vast complex underground, such as pipes and network junctions leading downwards. A crew who sneaks into a private office can discover references to chambers on the -1 level. All signs point to the Inner Ring as the access point to that secret facility.\\n\\nPatients are brought below ground another way. On the second floor there are four special rooms, called the Dreampod Chambers. Here the patient is sealed within a sophisticated pod, which puts them into deep sleep using electromagnetic emitters. Once the sensors detect a state of deep sleep, a secret opening in the floor sends the dreampod below. The crew can ride the pods to travel below if they discover how the system works, and could potentially fool the system with fake biodata to avoid sending one of their own into dreamland. Brute force can also open the delivery tubes, but opening the Harnessing Chamber doors without a pod going through automatically puts the below ground security system in standby (see Security At The Anthill, page 242).\\n\\nSearching for leads on Dr. Haraguchi Sumire in the Inner Ring can reveal printed documents in one of the psychological assessment suites, indicating she was tested and sent to \"priority treatment\" in the Dreampod Chambers.\\n\\n# ZEN GARDEN COURTYARD\\nAt the center of the building there\\'s a round courtyard, open to the sky. Huge windows of the surrounding Inner Ring overlook the zen garden below, dominated by a single, giant cedar tree in the middle. The courtyard serves as a calming space for patients in the clinic’s holistic sleep therapy approach, so the only security on the doors are keyed wristbands for staff and patients (keyed entry). No guards are posted here, but the garden is in such a central position in the building, that it’s almost always under constant observation by a patient from a window, or nurses and patients enjoying the tranquility of the courtyard, making it difficult to avoid being seen.\\n\\n# CLINIC CYBERSPACE\\nThe Anthill server sits inside the mind of a harnessed sleeper in the Cold Storage Chambers (page 246). Akechi Sandajii is a bitter ex-merc who used to be part of the same line of work as the crew before he joined the Dream cult in search of a new life. Tokyo found a use for his heightened alertness and combat skills by making him into a secure server. With his ever-vigilant presence, there\\'s little need to invest resources in further security measures, meaning the clinic\\'s cyberscape can run itself quickly and efficiently.\\n\\nThe Domain appears as a mirrored but digitized version of the clinic, with data packets streaming like ants everywhere. Accessing and modifying normal operations of the clinic (including control of all doors) is simple enough for a skilled hacker – almost too simple. In truth, Sandajii \\n', content_length=3557, page=244), Page(content='constantly-monitors-all-systems-4, as he is/the ants crawl-ing around. Any change to their patterns can be noticed by him as a Consequence.\\n\\nIf an intruder is detected, the ants crawl over their avatar and into their mind, dealing enter-the-dreamscope-3. Sandajii is too far gone to manifest himself, but as a creepy Threat you might present a ghostly image of him, mumbling to himself about how these intruders remind him of himself and how they mustn\\'t let themselves fall too far into the dream... as there\\'s no coming back.\\n\\nThere\\'s no crash! Limit to the server – it keeps repairing itself. In every Establish, have the ants regroup as a Threat, removing two crash tiers as a Consequence if unaddressed. The crew is not here to take the Domain down, only to gather a few details and maybe manage to subvert the alarm before logging out. Use this to give the sense Sandajii – and by proxy, Tokyo – simply cannot be matched in cyberspace.\\n\\nSnooping around in the documentation for Dr. Haraguchi reveals she was sent down to storage, to \"join the Dream,\" through the Dreampod Chambers. Also available are full building schematics, including the elevator and dreampod tunnels that connect to the hidden chambers below. Attempting to access some of the more obscure passages reveals it\\'s a completely different Domain, with an unhackable cryptogate. That\\'s Tokyo\\'s domain, and no one can simply enter it.\\n\\n### BELOW GROUND: THE CHAMBERS\\n\\nThe park where the Anthill is located has underground cisterns and aqueducts, originally built to direct water and prevent flooding. Due to climate change, these water sources have long ago dried up and were forgotten by city officials.\\n\\nTokyo built the Sugi Sleep Clinic at this location specifically to take advantage of the forgotten spaces, as a ready-made base of operations. A major tunnel runs under the very center of the clinic, with several smaller tunnels branching off to cisterns designed to hold floodwaters, now being used to store people.\\n\\nThe cyberspace Domain of the chambers is controlled directly by Tokyo. It is practically impossible to defeat or outsmart the hive mind in cyberspace, and the point can be made by placing a crypto-god-complexity-5 status on the Domain, affecting all hacking moves. An attempt to reduce this status immediately triggers the alarm and requires an immense amount of computational power to even attempt.\\n\\n### HARNESSING CHAMBER\\n\\nLocated directly below the Dreampod Chambers in the Inner Ring, this chamber is full of surgical beds and equipment. It is here that Tokyo fits new hive members with special neuro-link helmets that allows them to fully integrate into the cult\\'s dreamspace. Unlike normal Harnessing, these helmets are designed to keep a long-term and extremely thorough connection. New members are surgically fitted with the implants in this chamber before being moved to the Cold Storage Chambers for the implants to equilibrate over several weeks.\\n\\nSnooping around in this area can lead to plenty of information on Tokyo\\'s operation and the nature of the Harnessing technology it uses, assuming the crew manages to make sense of the perplexing design of devices that were created by the alien mind of an AI. This is where they could learn the true nature of Tokyo and get a glimpse of its scale and its various series. At the very least, it will serve as a guide to familiarizing themselves with the inner workings inside the Dream experience a subjective passage of time.\\n\\nTaking anything is risky, as every piece of tech is chipped and tracked, and removing a piece from this room alerts the hen\\'i ants from the adjacent Drone Nest, as well as the Security Guards above. If the PCs do manage to get away with some tech undetected, see the Tokyo Catalog (page 219), especially the Lasuis RealDream High Speed Harnessing Link.\\n\\n### DRONE NEST\\n\\nNear the Harnessing Chamber is a single, cramped chamber providing access to the nest of the hen\\'i ant. Hive members rarely have to enter this space so the ceiling is low and the place is packed tightly with food and water supplies for the ants, and not much light. Quiet investigation does not disturb the ants, though outright attacks would alert all of the hen\\'i ants at once and they\\'ll swarm the area.\\n\\nIn the back is a Security Trap-Jaw Ant-Bot (see page 248) which remains powered down for anything but a major threat. It will awaken, though, should the crew follow through on their Kidnapping from Paradise (page 246) or set off the alarm.', content_length=4495, page=245), Page(content='# COLD STORAGE CHAMBERS\\n\\nThese half-dozen rooms are where hive members are “stored” while their bodies and brains adjust to the Tokyo Harnessing pods or if their minds are needed for processing. The tight, coffin-like pods tend to their biological needs, connecting through tubes and syringes that have a slick but inhumane design, unappealing and insectile.\\n\\nAkechi Sandajii (Clinic Cyberspace, page 244) is stored here, as well as Dr. Haraguchi, see below.\\n\\nMore clues about Tokyo can be gathered here, but an attempt to dismantle or analyze a pod is bound to end in failure. This is some of Tokyo’s most important and robust work, and special equipment and training is required to even begin to handle any of it. The people themselves are dispensable though, and if Tokyo sees a need, it can open all the pods and have the barely-conscious humans, driven mostly by their reptilian brain, suddenly erupt into a vicious mob. They attack anyone Tokyo identifies as a potential threat (hurt-or-subdue-2, mindlessly-aggressive-2, Scale 2, Threat: Crowd around an intruder, Consequence: Grab, kick and punch wildly (bruised-2)).\\n\\nOpening the chambers also creates a thick cold mist from the spilled chill air.\\n\\n## DR. HARAGUCHI\\n\\nIn one of the Cold Storage Chambers is Dr. Haraguchi Suime. In her efforts, which obviously curb access to her having eyesight, Dr. Haraguchi is staring blankly from within the pod she is encased in.\\n\\nAny PC who gathered some information about this technology, or who has expert understanding of VR, can tell that Dr. Haraguchi is still in the early stages of assimilation and her mind is still her own. She can disconnect if she chooses to, and the pod will eject her. Therefore it is possible to sever Dr. Haraguchi’s connection to the hivemind carefully from within, by entering the dreamscape and escorting her outside. This way is safer for the doctor, but riskier for the crew; it’s explained under Kidnapping from Paradise (page 246).\\n\\nThe pod can also be deactivated with an action, but it has a perplexing design and is connected to an alarm system. It can also be smashed, which automatically activates the alarm and calls the Security Trap Jaw Bot from the Drone Nest. In either case, the doctor will have to be forcibly removed from the neural link to disconnect her from the Tokyo dreamscape, and any PC with some understanding in cyberware can tell that this would be devastating to her psyche. What they might not be aware of, though, is that Dr. Haraguchi will also be subject to the psychological shock of being removed from paradise. She takes dissociated-5 for leaving the peaceful land she spent so many subjective years in, rendering her incapable of doing anything but staring blankly and mumbling to herself, meaning the crew members will have to carry her out, or lead her slowly by hand.\\n\\n# KIDNAPPING FROM PARADISE\\n\\nThough she was only flagged as missing several days ago by her employer, Dr. Haraguchi’s psyche has spent a decade of subjective time within the dreamscape. She’s accustomed to her current world and barely remembers the “real” one, and therefore sees no reason to leave.\\n\\n# CONNECTING TO TOKYO\\n\\nThe crew can connect to the VR dreamscape of Tokyo in one of several ways.\\n\\nCharacters who took the status enter-the-dreamscape-5 are already there. Easy! In fact, in the time the rest of the crew took to infiltrate the underground chambers, the trapped PCs have already spent several weeks in this simulation of an idyllic, old-fashioned world, waiting for their friends to rescue them. Each such PC takes one of the following statuses of their choice: frustrated-4, liking-it-here-4, or o-bit-rusty-4; this can be mitigated as normal.\\n\\nConnecting to the dream via AR or simple screens provides some measure of protection from the hivemind, but it’s very difficult to compensate for the time difference. Characters who are not Harnessed have a log-3 status which cannot be reduced and affects every action within the dreamscape. However, they can mitigate normally against the digital agents within.\\n\\nPCs that choose to Harness into the dreamscape with their own gear can find relays to connect through the Cold Storage Chambers. They experience lag-1 for not using the special headgear. They also gain the story tag too real which cannot be burned or removed, and hinders mitigation rolls inside the dreamscape.\\n\\nFinally, PCs can enter one of the empty pods and engage directly with the system. They experience no lag, but while inside the dream they have the story tags too real and feels\\n', content_length=4555, page=246), Page(content=\"right at home which cannot be burned or removed, and hinder mitigation rolls inside the dreamscape. In addition, because they are not using the special Tokyo headgear (which requires a prolonged and delicate operation in order to be fitted), they are in danger of suffering long-term-brain-damage-1 if they stay inside the dream for longer than half an hour or so.\\n\\n## INSIDE THE DREAM\\n\\nThe crew will appear in the same place (unless you want them to get lost-4 and also draw on each other’s connection). It’s a section of the Tokyo dreamscape resembling a small village in the shadow of a beautiful mountain. The weather is nice, the smell of spring flowers is in the air, a soft breeze makes the wind chimes dance and jingle. The village is hosting a music festival, and the sounds are rich and inviting.\\n\\nDr. Haraguchi is participating in the music festival, and feels-right-at-home-4. Originally, she didn’t want to join this dreamscape, but that was many years ago, and in that time she got so accustomed to the place that she even forgot it’s a VR realm. She became a potter and is living a full life, although she isn’t aware that parts of her mind are being selectively removed over time. She is still proud of her artistic achievements and has time for her friends and family outside, which the crew can build on if they remind her of her previous life.\\n\\nMany of the people in the village are fellow dreamers, who have spent many years here, but some are NPC-like entities emulated by Tokyo. Taking action to further examine the dreamers can reveal that aspects of their personalities are simply missing and they lost many social skills. A hacker can trace their signals to realize these people are literally losing their minds, as more and more of the brain is absorbed into the collective consciousness.\\n\\n## WAKING UP\\n\\nLogging out is a simple matter, as it only requires one to call up a tori gate, which appears at the edge of the village, and walk through it. A person can even be pushed through the gate, but this isn’t different from forcibly disconnecting them, inflicting dissociated-5. Also, unless the person was first convinced they should return to the physical world, they also take dream-longing-5.\\n\\nIf Dr. Haraguchi is convinced to walk out, she still takes dream-longing-3 when she wakes up and it’ll be several months of therapy before she can acclimate fully back to the real world.\\n\\nA PC with an enter-the-dreamscape-5 status cannot call up a tori gate, as they are being forcibly kept unconscious. Should they jump through someone else’s gate they can attempt to mitigate the dissociated status. Their bodies are inside one of the pods in the Cold Storage Chambers, and the pods open and release them once they are out of the dream.\\n\\n## SYSTEM DEFENSES\\n\\nIf the crew draws attention, the other dreamers in the server will react with anger and fear to one of their members being removed from this paradise. Use the Tokyo Villager Mob Challenge, below.\\n\\nThe cultists are not particularly dangerous, but can pose a significant delay while the system calls for further backup, mainly due to their willingness to put themselves in danger in order to uphold Decree One.\\n\\nWhen they set out to rescue a dreamer, they do not care if that person is leaving willingly or not. As they are pulling them into the village they give the dreamer out-of-reach-2, which hinders all attempts by PCs to take them out of the dream.\\n\\nYou can also introduce one or more Ari Code Swarms (page 216) as a Consequence separately from the crowd, especially after the crew calls up a tori gate.\\n\\n## TOKYO VILLAGER MOB\\n\\n**LIMITS**\\n\\nHURT OR SUBDUED 2 | SCARE AWAY 4\\n\\n**TAGS & STATUSES**\\n\\nzealous-2, Scale 1\\n\\n**THREATS / CONSEQUENCES**\\n\\n- **Crowd around an intruder or a friend in need**  \\n  Grab, kick and punch wildly, or strike with rakes, hoes, and carpentry tools (bruised-2, and out-of-reach-2 to a dreamer in the PC's hands)  \\n  Swarm from the village towards the commotion (increase Scale by 1, to a maximum of 3)\\n\\n- **Regroup while ghostly ants materialize around them**  \\n  Gain a boost or skill needed in the fight as Tokyo upgrades their avatars (gain a tier-2 status such as fast-2 or a story tag such as bo-fighting).  \\n  The ants materialize into an Ari swarm (Present a new Challenge: Ari Code swarm, page 216)\\n\", content_length=4322, page=247), Page(content=\"For a final showdown, after the crew escape the dreamworld, you can activate the Security Trap-Jaw Ant-Bot as the PCs get on their feet and start to make their way out.

Does it send tiny ants into their homes and VR domains, to spy on them? Perhaps it is planting tracking devices in order to see what the PCs are doing, and if they are worthy of being assimilated.

In this era of unprecedented data theft and corruption, our Dangan sen (“bullet line”) presents the best in fast and secure transmissions, a framework of encryption and counter-intrusion measures traveling along hidden tracks in cyberspace.\\n\\nFor especially sensitive data packets, we offer an upgraded service which includes additional programs and Harnessed guards. You can rest assured that your precious data is safe and secure on our bullet trains.”\\n\\nRight. This is where you come in.\\n\\n# BACKGROUND\\nBiting the Bullet is a VR train heist scenario that can be run from either direction: the crew could either be defending the valuable data on the train from being stolen, or carry out the heist themselves. It’s up to the MC to decide how to use and present the scenario.\\n\\nThe cyberspace bullet train is called the Genbi Danggan sen, belonging to the data transport fleet of the Dangan Group.\\n\\n## THE GREAT DATASTREAM ROBBERY\\nMaboroshi Labs is a small company that developed a program to create genetically-combined hybrid creatures using an Esoteric Source, carvings copied from a temple wall. They hoped that the power of the baku (chimerical creatures in Japanese legend that eat bad dreams) will help stabilize their experiment where science fell short. The scientists managed to create living bugs but unfortunately, their program kept yielding unstable results. In legend, the baku can turn on their summoners if called too often but these failed hybrids were stolen from the start.\\n\\nRecently Maboroshi decided to unload the entire project to the larger Chrysanthemum Biosciences, a biotechnology corporation who shares a zaibatsu with them. Scientists at Chrysanthemum think they can fix the problems in the chimeric process – or perhaps they just want violent chimeras; Chrysanthemum has somewhat of a mercenary reputation. First, though, a whole lot of data needs to be transferred from the Maboroshi servers to Chrysanthemum.\\n\\nEnter Danggan sen, and their top-of-the-line cyberspace “bullet train” secure data transfer service. Whether the PCs attack the train to protect it, they will have to take into account the train’s Intrusion Countermeasures: encrypted cars, a unique vista wrap mechanism (see page 251) that changes the VR environment around the train, and the automated Karakuri Attendants security programs (page 254).\\n\\nThe encrypted Maboroshi Labs data is represented on the train as artwork, a set of nine heavy paintings. Unlike most heists, though, the payday is not just loot to be protected or stolen – it’s also a danger unto itself. Over the course of the train ride, the Mythos power in the data will be degrading the encryption, the compressed data will leak out, and a dramatically appropriate moment digital versions of the Failed Baku Hybrids (page 255) will emerge and start to hunt and attack defenders and thieves alike.\\n\\nThe PC crew will also face a rival crew in the form of the Nightclouders (page 254), employees of Maboroshi Labs who worship the Baku Mythos. If the PCs are pulling the heist, the Nightclouders are guarding the train; if the PC’s are the protectors, the Nightclouders are pulling the heist.\\n\\n## HOOKS\\n- **As defenders:** The crew is hired by Chrysanthemum as security consultants tasked with ensuring delivery. They are provided with the itinerary and some basic support (see Defending Crew itinerary, page 256) and half payment upfront – the other half with the safe arrival of all items at the Chrysanthemum station.\\n\\n- **As attackers:** The crew is hired by a rival third company looking to steal the data for themselves. They can provide the crew with only a few details (see Attacking Crew itinerary, page 260), and will pay for each piece the crew manages to steal. For a more intense scenario, the company needs the theft go unnoticed, requiring the crew to replace stolen pieces with forgeries and keep the entire operation covert.', content_length=4001, page=250), Page(content=\"# THE GENBI DANGANSEN\\n\\nThe Genbi DanganSen is as beautiful as it is secured. Decorated with shiny golds and deep reds, with sophisticated ornaments along the edges of every roof and on every door, the bullet train is an impenetrable fortress in the guise of a piece of art.\\n\\nBelow are the descriptions of the four cars of the Genbi DanganSen and the IC deployed around it. The engine at the front is designed to optionally carry a harnessed engineer, but the system is automated and none are currently on board. In terms of size, each car is Scale 1, the whole train is Scale 2, and the train together with its VR enviroments (the Vista Wraps) is Scale 3.\\n\\n## OUTSIDE THE TRAIN: THE VISTA WRAPS\\n\\nWhile the bullet train travels from station to station through cyberspace, it is protected by a program that protects around it a counter-intrusion VR environment (“vista wrap”). The program cycles through its five vistas to protect the train from various types of intrusion: an Arctic Winter vista, an Enormous Stone vista, a Jungle vista, a Lava Field vista, and a Wild West vista.\\n\\nThese wraps have different uses and purposes and the vista wrap can change to respond to different threats; if they are detected, the vista starting to flicker can change is a Threat, followed by the consequence of the vista switching, which the PCs can only avert if they already hacked into the Vista Wrap Generator in the third car (page 251).\\n\\nAnyone inside the Genbi DanganSen is safe from the vista effects, even if there is an opening cut into the train's roof or walls. The vista wraps are switched off while docking in a station.\\n\\n## THE HULL\\n\\nThe outer shell of the train is a powerful encryption barrier, designed to direct access from cyberspace. It is decorated with a protective decal of natural motifs in gold paint: Flowering vines and branches cover the walls of the train and dragon spirits cover the doors. Once the train starts traveling, these motifs activate and start moving slowly in rhythmic patterns, looking for intruders to entangle.\\n\\nIntruders – whether stealthy infiltrators or bold raiders – need to break through the train's densely-tangled reinforced hull, hindered by both status and tag. The tier of the status equals the ordinal number of the car: the engine is lightest in the first car, the Karkuri Attendant Storage (densely-tangled-1) and becomes denser the farther back you go, reaching its maximum encryption power in the fourth car, the Art Gallery Car (densely-tangled-4).\", content_length=2497, page=251), Page(content='Breaking through the hull or creating a person-sized hole in the hull is an action with a quick outcome. Weaken can be used to remove the tangle status, making it easier to then break in.

The third and fourth car have dragon spirit motifs on the outside doors, which can awaken and snap at intruders (wounded at the same tier of densely-tangled).\\n\\n# FIRST CAR: KARAKURI ATTENDANT STORAGE\\nThis is the first car behind the engine. The car has no outside doors and one small window, barely enough to squeeze through if opened. Inside, in the dark, two rows of inactive, cloth-covered Karakuri Attendants hang from the ceiling along the walls; these are VR constructs in standby mode. Along the left side wall there are a few workstations used to provide servicing and maintenance to the Attendants. The active Attendants only enter this car in response to a security threat.\\n\\nThe car is often overlooked, and is packed full of covered Attendants and maintenance workstations that can provide hiding places and access to the Attendants’ code.\\n\\nWhen there is a need for an additional Attendant somewhere in the train, one of them will wake up in this car with a mechanical whirr (Threat) before beginning to do as instructed by the system (Consequence: Present a New Challenge: Karakuri Attendant).\\n\\n# SECOND CAR: PASSENGER SEATS\\nThis car is a first-class passenger car, with room for six passengers and their personal cargo. The DanganSen Group offers its clients the chance to Harness into the train and accompany their cargo on the trip in person.\\n\\nIn the attack scenario, the Nightclouders use this car as a guard post and keep three Nightclouders (Scale 1) here at all times. Stealthy PCs can learn their shift patterns and sneak through when they are on the move, or try to take them out in a quiet way. If a conflict erupts, one of the Nightclouders retreats to warn the others while the rest of them try to halt the advance of the PCs through the train for as long as possible.\\n\\nIn either scenario, there are probably a few Karakuri Attendants here (Scale 1), treating the defenders as first-class passengers to the point of comprehending their alertness. Use their Threats and Consequences to represent that.\\n\\nBesides the luxurious seats and the cargo racks, the car is fitted with an environment controller, capable of changing the interior decoration and design of the car, in essence a smaller and safer version of the vista wraps. Each of the seats also has a privacy module, allowing the seat and its contents to be hushed or shrouded off; a skilled infiltrator can easily gain access to those controls.\\n\\n## VISTA WRAP\\n**ENVIRONMENT DESCRIPTION AND THREAT**    | **DESIGNED AGAINST**    | **TAGS**    | **CONSEQUENCES**\\n---|---|---|---\\nArctic Winter    | White tracts, blowing snow and freezing temperatures.    | Quick-moving infiltrators    | blinding blizzard, freezing cold    | Ice grows rapidly on every exposed surface (Slippery -3, frostbite -3, or ice-encased -3)\\nEntropy Storm    | Glowing clouds rain shimmering lines of code.    | VR constructs and avatars    | buffeting winds    | Corrupted code erodes digital entities (glitched -4)\\nJungle    | Thick and impenetrable tropical foliage.    | “Flying” infiltrators landing on or attaching to train, above or below    | thick canopy, insect swarms    | A swarm of insects settles on an attacker (distracted -3 or unstable -3), a vehicle crashes into the trees (wrecked -3)\\nLava Fields    | Mountainside during a volcanic eruption.    | Brute force attackers    | impenetrable ash cloud    | Lava waves splash violently (Severe burns -3 or burn two weapon and armor tags)\\nWild West    | Open sun-baked desert or prairie.    | Stealthy infiltrators    | blazing sunlight, nowhere to hide    | Armed horseback enforcers open fire (gunshot-wound -2); sunlight burns off false credentials (burn a tag)\\n', content_length=4046, page=252), Page(content=\"### THIRD CARD: VISTA WRAP GENERATOR\\n\\nThis car is the most cramped, and is full of machinery and control stations lining up both walls, leaving a narrow path through the car. Large screens show the vista wraps in several versions – the current one as well as the other options that can be turned on from here. Dials and buttons can control the intensity and focus of the wraps, and someone who has hacked into the system from here can use them to direct the wraps for their benefit.\\n\\nTo gain this control, the user needs to max out take-over:5 and gain superuser privileges. If a PC manages to do this, they can change the vista wraps and direct their effects on specific locations outside of the train. By default, the Dangansen Group does not allow defending security consultants (whether the Nightclouder or the PCs) to access this car, if they try, the Attendants will attempt to prevent them from entering, unless the Attendants have a more urgent task. \\n\\nThe car is crammed to the brim with bulky machinery, interfering with any kind of movement in or through the car. The screens, cabinets and machines hide many nooks and crannies that can serve as protected hiding spots, such as the ones infiltrating Nightclouder scouts are looking for during The First Leg (see Defending The First Leg, page 256).\\n\\nKarakuri Attendants pass through this car often. Use their Challenge profiles to present obstacles to PCs trying to sneak or fight their way through.\\n\\n### FOURTH CAR: ART GALLERY\\n\\nLike the historical Genbi Shinkansen, the train is a mobile art gallery: the fourth and largest car is an elegant exhibition space, where precious pieces of artwork hang along the left side walls.\\n\\nNine large and bulky paintings are displayed here in a line, representing a highly-compressed payload housing immense amounts of data. They are all along the left side wall, while the right side one has large reinforced windows, showing the vista wraps at all times. In between, the wooden floor is open and spacious. \\n\\nA group of Attendants (Scale 1) is here, and in the attack scenario, most of the Nightclouders (Scale 2) will be here as well, defending their cargo.\\n\\nThe floors here are nightingale floors, loose wooden boards that chirp gently when stepped on – not loud enough to ruin a gallery viewer's experience, definitely too loud for a sneaky thief trying to advance unnoticed.\\n\\n### DANGAN CENTRAL STATION\\n\\nAll the myriad tracks of the Dangansen transmission network come together in Dangan Central, a VR space rendered as a busy and engaging train station with incoming and outgoing bullet trains. Platforms are filled with cargo representing data packets, and countless inspectors scan and verify each and every one. An announcement calls out an incoming bullet train and mechanized attendants move toward the track to run security checks. At another platform, a train is cleared and begins to zip away toward its final destination, with a booming sound.\\n\\nA great many trains arrive at Dangan Central for data verification and virus-scanning, and every datastram has its own platform, separated from the rest. The many automated services, chief among them the Karakuri Attendants, are able to pass through the large sliding doors separating platforms with proper authorization codes. To everyone else, the doors are solid.\", content_length=3324, page=253), Page(content='# ACTIVE PROGRAMS & USERS\\n\\n## KARAKURI ATTENDANTS\\n\\nThe Attendants are Dangansan agent subroutines that visually resemble karakuri puppets, mechanized Japanese automata from the 17th to 19th century, with gears hidden under porcelain faces and traditional but circuit-patterned garb. Their dainty appearance betrays their fragility, but their movements are decisive and deadly, with almost imperceptible shifts of their mechanisms. Every Karakuri Attendant has a unique appearance, and they’re all expert gunslingers and archers, with excellent visual acuity.\\n\\nThere are about a dozen automatons active at any time, but the Genbi Dangansan can activate new ones if needed, releasing them from the Karakuri Attendant Storage car.\\n\\nThe Attendants are friendly towards the PCs if they are defending the train, or if they are infiltrating but have successfully disguised themselves.

These hybrids are failed experiments, however, and their appetites are stronger.\\n\\n## SPRINGING THE BAKU HYBRIDS AT THE RIGHT MOMENT\\n\\nThe job takes a sharp turn when the Failed Baku Hybrids break out of their compressed containers (the paintings) and begin their devouring rampage. This is a dramatic cinematic moment that might change the job from heist to survival horror.\\n\\nThe hybrids attack indiscriminately, and the crew, the Nightclouders, and the Attendants are all in danger. When introducing them, encourage the players to take in the new situation and adjust their tactics—running away, using the chaos to complete their original mission, cooperating with the Nightclouders to survive, and other previously unlikely outcomes can be considered and given a chance to succeed.\\n\\nThe best point to introduce the hybrids is when the actual theft of the paintings is underway, meaning in the gallery car, while the infiltrators already have their hands on some of the paintings. Have the hybrids appear and immediately attack whoever is handling the paintings, be it friend or foe.\\n\\nIf the PCs act exceptionally well as the defenders, the Nightclouders might not even make it to the gallery car. In that case, introduce the hybrids at a point in time where it would be the most inconvenient for the players.

The Nightclouders are former employees of Maboroshi Labs, fired after they became too emotionally invested and possessive of the project.\\n\\nThey began worshiping the Baku Mythos and were discovered when they tried to take project data out of the company's labs. Now that their former employer is selling the project and moving the data, the Nightclouders see a second chance to get their hands on it.\\n\\n## THE NIGHTCLOUDERS' ATTACK PLAN\\n\\nThe Nightclouders' plan is to attack in force during The Second Leg. To prepare for that, they employ two clandestine measures ahead of time.\\n\\nFirst, they sneak a few of their numbers on board during the First Leg under the cover of a distraction in the form of a VR monster attack. The scouts then make their way to the vista wrap generator car, preparing to take control of it before the main attack.\\n\\nSecond, while the train stops at Dangan Central, a member of the Nightclouders will sneak on board disguised as a Karakuri Attendant, and will scope out the active defensive measures present – i.e., the crew's hackler will try to disrupt the crew's abilities directly before the main attack begins.\\n\\n## PREPARING FOR THE JOB\\n\\n### CHRYSANTHEMUM SUPPORT\\n\\nChrysanthemum can grant PCs access to equipment, but will not give it for free – the players need to roll to Create useful tags before going out on the job. This action can be boosted with negotiation tags and tags representing favorable relations with the Chrysanthemum handler.\\n\\nChrysanthemum might be in biotech, but their resources include security and cybersecurity gear, so they can provide the crew with weapons, hacking apps, and almost anything else they need to equip themselves to protect the crew in cyberspace. The tags created can be kept at the job's end and added to loadout themes, with the weakness tag tagged by Chrysanthemum.\\n\\n## GENBI DANGANSEN SUPPORT\\n\\nThe crew also has the benefit of working with the powerful Genbi Dangansen Security system. They receive a holographic presentation explaining the train's layout, its defenses, and its capabilities.\\n\\nYou can share with the players the passive defensive measures that the train employs, including the wrist wraps and the specific defenses on, in, and between the different cars (page 251). Note Dangansen doesn’t allow anyone into the vista wrap generator car.\\n\\nDon't overload the players with all of this information upfront – tell them that they have access to it when they need it and let them ask you when it is relevant. If they don't bother preparing properly, it's on them.\\n\\nDuring the job, they can maneuver easily and effortlessly throughout the train. However, unless the train is under attack, they do not have similar authorization to venture outside of the train while it is moving, since the company sees this as a security risk.\\n\\nThe Karakuri Attendants might not be as helpful as the crew expects. Genbi Dangansen values the Attendants as a significant security asset and symbol of luxury and prestige. Even as the defenders, the crew might find that the Attendants get in their way in the worst of times.\\n\\n## DEFENDING AT MABOROSHI STATION\\n\\nRepresented as a small Japanese rural station with the Maboroshi Labs logo everywhere, this is where the encrypted data is boarded onto the train, depicted as pieces of artwork. As the hired security, the crew will oversee the Karakuri Attendants (page 254) as they bring the nine paintings onto the gallery car and place them up on frames along the left side wall.\\n\\nDescribe the look and feel of the train to the players. Even if they already studied the train's layout and defensive measures, this is the first time they get to experience it on-screen. Make it clear how much effort Dangansen Group puts in making the train beautiful, elegant and luxurious.\\n\\n## DEFENDING THE FIRST LEG\\n\\nDuring the first leg, the Nightclouders send an advance team of three Nightclouder agents (Scale 1) to board the train covertly and hide themselves before the main attack starts in the Second Leg.\", content_length=4171, page=256), Page(content=\"# THE DISTRACTION\\nAs a distraction to help with the infiltration, the Nightclouders launch a kraken-shaped hacking app against the train. The **Datastream Kraken**, a mechanical kraken Construct with a glowing core and multiple tentacles, tries to reach into the train and find the paintings. It's designed to draw attention and take time to defeat, but do little damage, as the Nightclouders don’t want to risk damaging the paintings inside the train.\\n\\n# THE INFILTRATION\\nWhile the Kraken is attacking the train, the Nightclouder scouts enter the datastream on digital gliders and land on the train's roof. They stealthily progress across the roof until they get to the visa wrap generator car, drill a hole, and descend into the machinery cabinets to find a hiding place.\\n\\nThere are several ways that the PCs can catch on to the stealthy infiltration:\\n\\n- If the PCs defeat the Kraken expediently swiftly – within one or two actions – then they will hear the impact of the scouts landing on the roof.\\n\\n- If a PC chooses to scout or scan other parts of the train while the Kraken attack is ongoing, a successful action may reveal the presence of the infiltrators.\\n\\n- If a PC goes outside of the train during the fight, they might perceive the scouts while they are moving from car to car. Present this as a Threat such as *You hear footsteps behind you*, ideally together with a Kraken Threat, forcing the PC to choose what to focus on.\\n\\n- If they inspect the train for damage after the fight is over, they can find the spot in the roof of the generator car where the scouts got in.\\n\\nAs a **Consequence**, give the Nightclouder infiltrators *stealthy-3* (as in their Challenge profile). To avoid revealing the clandestine attempt, keep these Consequences to yourself as long as the players are unaware of the infiltration; reveal them only when the PCs begin to actively search for the Nightclouders.\\n\\nIf the scouts are detected or found, they will try to slip away, find a different hiding place and complete their infiltration. If this also becomes impossible, they will disconnect, even risking brain damage; they do everything they can to avoid getting caught, imprisoned, and interrogated.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## DATastream Kraken\\n\\nThe Kraken’s metallic body is composed of the core and six long, slippery tentacles, all in glinting silver. Each tentacle is Scale 1, has its own *destroy-tentacle* limit, and can be attacked individually. Actions that target several or all tentacles are Scale 2. As long as any of the tentacles are intact, the core will keep its distance from the train while the tentacles attack the train occupants.

The PCs, whether on board the train or scoping it out from within the station, see them bring aboard a specialist Karakuri Attendant shaped like a painter to tighten the compression. PCs who inquire are refused further information politely by the Karakuri Attendants, as usual, and will not be allowed to interfere with the process. However, successfully studying this process can still provide a few details:\\n\\n- The specialist Attendant seems to take a lot of time and delicate care to verify the encryption, as if they are expecting it to be degraded for some reason.\\n- A part of the securing process is properly affixing the paintings to their heavy racks; moving them around might compromise that encryption.\\n\\n## THE NIGHTCLOUDER INFILTRATORS\\n\\nThe Nightclouders scouts in the vista wrap generator car, if still present, are well-hidden. Finding them requires making out a progress limit of `security-scan-1`. If found, the scout\\'s first priority is to not get caught alive, and they will do everything required to achieve this end, including disconnecting themselves unsafely from their Harness.\\n\\n## A SECOND INFILTRATOR\\n\\nWhile the paintings are being serviced, the Nightclouders send their second infiltrator: a hacker from their ranks, disguised as a Karakuri Attendant, has infiltrated Dangan Central and will board the Genbi Dangen as part of the movement of Attendants on and off the train. The hacker’s goal is to find the defenders (i.e., the PCs) and damage their capabilities directly and clandestinely before the attack during The Second Leg. The more damage the hacker wreaks, the more the PCs might suspect an interloper and take actions to locate the offender.\\n\\n## THE CLOCK IS TICKING\\n\\nThe players might choose to look through the train for any remaining scouts from The First Leg, or for the hacker if they start suspecting that something is amiss. They might also want to set up their defenses on the train in preparation for the rest of the trip, or look around the gallery to find out more about the Attendant’s activities during the data securing process. They have limited time to carry out any of these activities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Set a `servicing-complete:3` Limit as a timer. As a consequence for any action, or if the players spend a lot of time discussing options and don\\'t carry out any actions, apply `servicing-complete:1` to the Limit.

They appear in full force riding flying shadowy beasts reminiscent of the baku hybrids. The main group (Scale 2) board the train in the Karakurí Attendant storage car and move to the gallery in order to steal the paintings. A smaller force (Scale 1) stays behind on the flying steeds to catch the paintings when they are thrown off board.\\n\\n### THE NIGHTCLOUDER\\'S ADVANCE\\n\\nAs the scene progresses, continue to describe the ongoing threat of the Nightclouder attack. As a consequence, have the Nightclouders advance another stage in their attack:\\n\\n**The Nightclouders continue to advance...**\\n- Board\\n- Enter the first car\\n- Enter the second car\\n- Enter the third car\\n- Enter the fourth car\\n- Blow a hole in the hull\\n- Begin unloading the paintings\\n- Finish unloading\\n- Escape\\n\\nAny of these stages can be interrupted and set back by the PCs actions. For example, if the PCs seal the hole made by the Nightclouders, they will have to reopen it or unload the paintings another way. Determine how many Nightclouders are in every car based on their progress and the ongoing fight with the PCs.\\n\\nOnce the Nightclouders have boarded, they start moving back through the train. Their goal is not to take the PCs down, although they will do so if pressed; they want to get to the gallery cars as quickly as possible. They will not back down or stop now that they are so close to the object of their obsession.\\n\\n### CONTROLLING THE VISTA WRAPS\\n\\nThe party controlling the Vista Wraps (page 251) via the Vista Wrap Generator Car (page 253) — whether the Nightclouder infiltrators from the first leg, Dangsang security, or the PCs — can use it to hinder their opponents.\\n\\n### A NASTY SURPRISE\\n\\nThis scene is also when the final twist is revealed: the Failed Baku Hybrids. Once a few paintings have been moved from their stands, have a couple of hybrids (Scale 1) shimmer into being and immediately attack someone nearby. See Springing the Baku Hybrids at the Right Moment (page 255).\\n\\n## THE DRAMATIC LAST MILE\\n\\nThe fighting throughout this leg should be exciting and dangerous. If the PCs manage to stay out of harm’s way and seem to be in control of the situation, you have several ways to notch up the difficulty level on the fly:\\n\\n- If the Hacker from the station is still on board, they will rejoin the fight, still disguised as an Attendant if possible.\\n- If the scouts are still embedded in the vista wrap generator car, once their job enabling the boarding is done, they can jump out and surprise the PCs with an attack from an unexpected direction.\\n- Karakurí Attendants can join and \"help\" the PCs while actually getting in their way.\\n- The Hybrids themselves can appear at any point where they will shock the players and subvert their expectations.\\n- If any of the combatants use methods that inflict heavy damage to the train, you can set a derail; limit, representing the entire train reeling and shaking and eventually plummeting into the wilds of cyberscape.\\n\\n### ARRIVING AT CHRYSANTHEMUM STATION\\n\\nThe station representing the Chrysanthemum server is similar to the Maboroshi Station but larger and with a different corporate logo.\\n\\nIf any Failed Baku Hybrids or infiltrators remain active on the train, the corporation hardens its Domain firewall (fire-walled=5, Scale 4) around the terminal and refuses to open the doors, not even to its own mercenaries. No one goes in or out until the threat is neutralized one way or another.\\n\\n## THE BEST OFFENSE IS DEFENSE\\n\\nA clever way of stealing the paintings would be to take on the job of the defending crew and pretend to do it well, gaining the trust of the Dangsang security team and their clients just before betraying them.\\n\\nIf the crew successfully defends the cargo during The First Leg and in Dangsang Central station, you may reward them all with trusted-3, which represent both digital permissions and interpersonal trust that they can exploit during The Second Leg to escape with the paintings.', content_length=4102, page=259), Page(content=\"# ATTACKING CREW ITINERARY\\n\\nIn this scenario, the crew are hired by a third party or run the heist for themselves to steal the data from the train before it reaches its final destination. The Nightclouders are Maboroshi Labs employees who worship the Baku Mythos and are securing the transfer to Chrysanthemum Biosciences.\\n\\nThey are emotionally invested in the project and zealously guard the data. After the transfer, they will become Chrysanthemum employees so as to remain close to this Source.\\n\\nA successful heist involves boarding the train (presumably on an equally-fast vehicle), offloading the paintings (presumably to a vehicle), and escaping into cyberspace.\\n\\n## THE NIGHTCLOUDERS’ DEFENSIVE PLAN\\n\\nThe Nightclouders work in tandem with the DanganSen IC – such as the Karakuri Attendants, the Vista Wraps, and the protective device of the Hull – to detect and eliminate any intruders. If you feel the crew is advancing too fast (and don’t forget the Baku Hybrids at the end), the Nightclouders can deploy a SōheIC (page 129) to take care of the crew.\\n\\n## PREPARING FOR THE JOB\\n\\n### HEIST PREPARATIONS\\n\\nRather than play out the prep before the heist, you can start the heist in media res and use flashbacks to the Prep Sequence during the heist, Ocean-style (see Heists, Metro:Otherscape, page 125).\\n\\nThe crew's employers or informants have partial information on the Genbi DanganSen security systems. They can tell the crew about the Vista Wraps, although they don’t have a full list of them. They also know that the first car after the engine, the Karakuri Attendant storage, is the most easy to break into, and they know what’s in each car, although they don’t know the exact security measures employed. They know about the Karakuri Attendants and the Nightclouders, and can explain who both groups are and why they are on the train, but do not know their specific capabilities. Finally, they can provide a general timeline for the trip – anything directly under Train Itinerary (page 251).\\n\\n## ATTACKING THE CORPORATE STATIONS\\n\\nDue to their tight, top-grade cybersecurity, the Maboroshi Labs Domain and the Chrysanthemum Bioscience Domain are probably unrealistic targets for the attacking crew, which is why the crew is attacking the train while in transit. The best they can get is a live feed showing them the data being loaded at Maboroshi Station, or perhaps the station's layout.\\n\\nTherefore, the attacking itinerary focuses on the first and second legs of the journey, and stop at Dangan Station. You can describe the train being loaded, leaving Maboroshi Station, and (after the job) arriving at Chrysanthemum Station as cutscenes (see the Defending Crew Itinerary for a description of Maboroshi station, page 256).\\n\\n## ATTACKING DURING THE FIRST LEG\\n\\nThis is the crew's first chance to board the train and carry out the heist. To do this, they will need to enter the datastream and board the train, then make it into the gallery car with either brute force or stealth, steal the paintings, and make away with them.\\n\\n### BOARDING, BREACHING, AND ADVANCING IN THE TRAIN\\n\\nTo board the train, the crew needs to bring their vehicle side-by-side with the train (a quick outcome for the pilot, with unstable-2 as a Consequence), and then each leap (or otherwise transport themselves) onto the train (another quick outcome for each, or a Scaled quick outcome for all). The danger facing them is from the Vista Wraps, which will attempt to change into an appropriate vista to counter their abilities.\\n\\nOnce on the train, the crew must breach the train's Hull and deal with its protective decals, all the while still under the Vista Wraps’ effects. The crew can choose to enter any car, breaking into the Karakuri Attendant Storage Car is easiest.\", content_length=3757, page=260), Page(content=\"and the car itself is ideal for regrouping and planning next steps before carrying on. Other cars are harder and less safe to break into, but closer to the ultimate goal. Refer to the layout of the Gembi Dangansen (page 251) in order to see which obstacles and opportunities each car offers. In any car, you can always Present a New Challenge (Karakuri Attendant or Nightclouder) as a Consequence, if needed.\\n\\nMoving between cars is not trivial, as the doors separating the cars are locked. Opening them with hacking, weapons or any other means requires a quick outcome, with encryption-2 hindering all attempts.\\n\\nTHE CLOCK IS TICKING\\nOnce the attack begins, set an arrive:5 Limit as a timer, and apply arriving-1 as a Consequence whenever the crew is forced to wait or retreat in order to not be discovered. When arrive moves out, the train reaches Dangan Central, where the gallery fills with Karakuri Attendants servicing the paintings. This means that the crew must hide – perhaps in the machinery in the Vista Wraps Generator Car or the first class seats in the Passenger Car. See Attacking at Dangan Central (page 261) for what might happen then.\\n\\nRAISING THE ALARM\\nThe security view of the train can be styled before they’ve reached the gallery if they’re spotted and allow one of the train’s defenders to raise the alarm, which can be a simple Consequence delivered in case they do not prevent a guardian from escaping and informing others (Escalate the Situation). In this case, the entirety of available defenders – Nightclouders (scale 2) and Karakuri Attendants (Scale 2) descend on the crew, possibly necessitating a tactical retreat.\\n\\nA NASTY SURPRISE\\nOnce the PCs have their hands on the paintings, and before they manage to offload them from the car, complicate matters by introducing the Failed Baku Hybrids. This raises the general alarm if it didn’t yet happen, and means chaos breaks loose in the gallery. See Springing the Baku Hybrids at the Right Moment (page 255).\\n\\nATTACKING AT DANGAN STATION\\nSee a description of the station on page 253. The crew might avoid the station entirely by retreating from the train and trying to board the train again after it leaves for the second leg of the journey. If they are here at all, they will be in one of two places during this stop: on board the train after having infiltrated it during the first leg, or outside the station trying to break in.\\n\\nThe station is teeming with Karakuri Attendants – definitely more than the crew could handle face to face. The gallery car is also full of Attendants examining and working on the paintings. The crew can perhaps infiltrate and scope out the work being done, but not steal the paintings themselves. The best that they can do is sit tight and wait until the train starts moving again.\\n\\nAVOIDING DETECTION\\nDuring the servicing, use Threats of attendants and Nightclouders searching the train and Consequences of burning tags and reducing statuses representing stealth, hiding places, and disguises. The PCs must endure one or two rounds of this, through actions like changing position, hacking security measures, preparing new disguises, etc. If they remain undetected, the train begins to move again and begins The Second Leg.\\n\\nBREAKING INTO DANGAN\\nIf the crew tries to break into the train via the station, they will need to bypass security measures of Dangan Central. You can simplify this by setting infiltrate:5 and let the players try making their way onto the train. Alternatively, you can use the Intrusion-countermeasures-3 and let the players try to access the train (Metro:Otherscape, page 308) to represent an advanced security system in the shape of a Karakuri Attendant in conductor’s uniform. Add observant Karakuri Attendants all over the station, and Nightclouders when the PCs arrive at the train's platform.\\n\\nATTACKING DURING THE SECOND LEG\\nThe crew might decide to board the train only now, or be forced to complete the mission now because of a delayed or failed attempt earlier. If this is a second attempt after a previous one failed and alerted security, the Nightclouders and the Dangansen IC are alert-2.\\n\\nBoarding the train and completing the mission is the same in this leg as it is during The First Leg, but reset arrive and when it maxes out this time, the train reaches Chrysanthemum Station, at which point the heist crew must disconnect or risk a much more painful fate of being caught by Chrysanthemum ICs (use a collective of Sohei ICs with the Naginata 2L8 Special, page 129).\", content_length=4519, page=261), Page(content=\"# AFTERMATH\\nEventually, someone (or no one?) has the artwork. But is it the right someone?\\n\\n- **As defenders:** If the Nightclouders stole any of the paintings, Chrysanthemum will not be pleased. They will probably try to leverage the situation and offer to pay the crew the second half of the payment if they go out and retrieve the paintings from wherever the Nightclouders are keeping them. If the crew does not do that, they will burn some bridges and take a hit to their reputation in the underworld. Delivering all the paintings intact, however, will be seen as the act of utmost professionalism it is, and will probably lead to valuable contacts and job offers.\\n\\n- **As attackers:** If any of the paintings were successfully stolen by the PCs, this means they are in possession of quickly degrading bulky data packets that randomly unleash dangerous digital beasts. Delivering the cargo to the crew's employers in time might be a challenge in itself. Additionally, Chrysanthemum, Maboroshi, and the Dangansen Group all have strong motives to uncover and punish the crew. Was the heist overt enough for them to even know who the thieves are? How far are the corporations willing to go to retrieve the stolen data?\\n\\n- Either way, if any Hybrids survived they could be studied and weaponized by some company, so this might not have been the last time the crew faced them.\", content_length=1375, page=262), Page(content='# LOST & FLOODED\\n## Enter the world of the discarded\\n\\n- **TO THE COFFIN COMPLEX**\\n- **THE UNDERGROUND DISCHARGE CHANNEL**\\n- **JUNK ISLAND**\\n\\n---\\n\\nProperty of City of Mist.

Unused stock, obsolete tech, and discarded prototypes eventually end up drifting into some backwater pit. In the eastern Tokyo Megacity, that pit is the **Underground Discharge Channels** underneath the Old Tokyo district.\\n\\nThis sprawling facility was once built to divert flood waters during typhoon seasons. Abandonment and lack of maintenance has turned it into an artificial swamp, stretching across an astonishingly wide area beneath the ground. It’s filthy, toxic, and several reports claim that yōkai are gathering there in large numbers, away from human eyes.\\n\\nAnd this is where your next job is, of course. Amid the filth and sogginess, you are sent to purge the tunnels from a troublesome yōkai infestation. Keep your eyes peeled while navigating the darkness, though, as old treasures and buried memories might surface.\\n\\n## BACKGROUND\\n\\nInspired by the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel constructed underneath Kasukabe in 2006, officials later greenlit the construction of similar facilities throughout the Megacity. One such facility was built under what is now Old Tokyo, but when the district was abandoned by the powers that be, so too were the tunnels underneath.\\n\\nYears of neglect has turned the **Underground Discharge Channels** into its own biome: a shadowed bog, permanently flooded, with heaps of trash forming overgrown islands.\\n\\nOver the years all sorts of strange lizards and insects made their home in the Channels, but none as strange as the yōkai **Chirizuka Kaiō**. A powerful being that looks like a hairy red man, resembling a small and filthy oni, Chirizuka Kaiō wears a golden crown and claims to be the king of trash and the tsukumogami – animated spirits of discarded objects. Away from prying eyes, Chirizuka Kaiō marked the Channels as his own dominion and has been amassing followers to create a haven for the lost, human and yōkai alike.\\n\\nIn one of the latest earthquakes to hit the eastern shore, new tunnels were revealed, connecting Chirizuka Kaiō's realm with a buried secret: the **Matsuyama Networks** coffin complex. Years ago, the telecommunication company built this underground facility as housing for their employees, allowing them to live and work inside personal tubes – comically nicknamed “coffins” – as they logged into the Matsuyama VR Domain. The next monsoon season, a power outage resulted in every worker in the facility losing their lives.\\n\\nEmployees who sign up for a 24/7 job deep underground tend to not have extensive social lives, and Matsuyama Networks was able to quickly cover up the loss of manpower and file it away. When Chirizuka Kaiō came upon this tomb, he was overjoyed with the opportunity to make it his **Forgotten Throne**, and moved in. His presence is now causing many of the discarded equipment and supplies left behind by Matsuyama Networks to slowly come to life as tsukumogami.\\n\\nRecent events on the surface may spell trouble for the king of trash. The **Neo-Samurai** (page 17) currently lay claim to much of Old Tokyo, and they’ve been scouring it top to bottom for Sources they can use to reinforce their authority. **Kojirō Takao**, ex-salryman and former employee of Matsuyama Networks, is leading a squad into the Underground Discharge Channels, but he’s not going after...\\n\", content_length=3426, page=264), Page(content=\"# TRASH DIVING\\n\\n## THE UNDERGROUND DISCHARGE CHANNEL\\n\\nThis chamber is so immense, it's hard to believe it was built at all, let alone underground. It stretches into the distance, the far away ceiling supported by giant round pillars of stone, each as wide as a bus. The pillars are placed in evenly spaced rows throughout the concrete cavern, like uncaring sentinels that keep watch while rot and decay spread all around them.\\n\\nThe chamber is filled with flood water up to waist-high, the water’s dark color and thick cover of moss obscuring everything beneath the surface. Over the years the lake has turned into an artificial swamp, and in several places, hiding in the dark or partly lit by still-active electrical lighting, are small islands made of trash build-ups, home to various insects and slimy reptiles. At the far end of the swamp a red figure rises from the water, lit by strangely mobile light sources.\\n\\nMaybe it’s the vast darkness that obscures how large this cistern truly is, or the fumes from the garbage and fetid water that mess with your senses, or the distant bloop from something hitting the water; whatever it is, it’s impossible to shake the feeling that someone – or something – is watching you.\\n\\nThe Underground Discharge Channel is an abandoned, pillared concrete cistern. Separated into several immense chambers and stretching for miles, this massive underground facility was built to divert flood waters during rain and typhoon season. Years of abandonment has led to its structure falling apart and a permanent, waist-high pool of water to accumulate.\\n\\n## REACHING THE CISTERN\\n\\nThe cistern is accessible via the sewer system underneath Old Tokyo after navigating a maze of abandoned tunnels. The navigation requires a quick outcome, with likely consequences being getting filthy or getting gear muddy. If they blunder the navigation completely, the crew suffers lost-2 which affects subsequent attempts. Depending on the story hook, Konda Hikaru or Chiba Takahiro can provide an old map of the sewers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### SOURCES\\n\\nThe bitter man is looking for the old Matsuyama Network, hoping to find it in some old data he could use to squeeze some money out of the company.\\n\\nOne old hard drive is indeed still functional, containing confidential data and proof that the facility existed. Were anyone to get a hold of this hard drive, they could use it to expose or even blackmail Matsuyama Networks. However, getting hold of the hard drive may not be as simple as picking it up. In the presence of Chizurika Kaïō, the hard drive has sprouted arms and legs...\\n\\n### HOOKS\\n\\n- Matsuyama Networks executive Chiba Takahiro, always sporting a slim suit and a thin smile, covertly hires the crew to search for the abandoned worker’s facility and clear out any yōkai. Takahiro believes there may be some decades-old data and legal documents left behind that he can exploit to get ahead in the company, but he tries to sell the job as an official corp request to “clear out squatters” from corp holdings, adding as a seemingly less pressing objective to “bring back any usable hard drives or files you find.” This request is accompanied by an extensive Non-Disclosure Agreement he asks the crew to sign, which forbids them from checking what’s on the drives or discussing this matter with others.\\n\\n- Konda Hikaru, a cigar-smoking, fire-aligned member of the Bureau of Onmyō, has received reports of increasing tsukumogami and other yōkai activity underneath Old Tokyo. Held up by red tape, but with access to a nice outsourcing budget, Konda tasks the crew with clearing out the “main nest” of hostile yōkai before they become a bigger problem.\\n\\n- A PC interested in finding a new Source begins to receive visions. A swamp of concrete. Objects with arms and legs. And a red figure with a broken crown sitting on a dark throne underground, bathed in squares of light, welcoming all who are lost.\\n\\n### LAYOUT\\n\\n- The Underground Discharge Channel\\n- Junk Island\\n- The Coffin Complex\\n- Inside The Coffin Complex\\n- Forgotten Throne\\n\\n---\\n\\nProperty of City of Mist.

Whether they are clearing out the cistern of yōkai or searching for The Coffin Complex, their search will eventually continue to **Junk Island**.\\n\\n## JUNK ISLAND\\nThe towering garbage heap is not a random accumulation of filth and refuse like the other islands, as the junk shows signs of having been gathered from all over. Old appliances, large pieces of discarded construction material and countless pieces of molding fabric have been piled to form a reasonably stable island almost 20 meters in diameter. And it\\'s occupied.\\n\\nOn the island\\'s highest \"peak\", four men stand, lighting each other with flashlights. From a distance it’s hard to tell who they are, but they don’t seem to be aware of you, for now.

This man is berating the others in low tones.\\n\\n### THE NEO-SAMURAI SQUAD\\nCurrently gathered on the mound are a squad of **Neo-Samurai**, led by **Kojiro Takao**. Takao uses the Neo-Samurai Challenge profile (page 182) without honoroble-3, and there are three ashigaru (page 182) with Scale 1 and with **iyol/-2** instead of **honorable-2**.\\n\\nTakao used to work at Matsuyama Networks in IT, but one too many missed promotions led him to quit and find purpose with the Neo-Samurai. He postures like a refined warrior, but he is in fact still holding an executive mindset, always looking for an edge on his competitors. This is what led him to grab a squad of new recruits and head out into the Channel in search of **The Coffin Complex** that Matsuyama Networks buried there, claiming it’s a yōkai hot spot (he\\'s right, but doesn\\'t know it). In truth, he is hoping to use his technical know-how to get into the systems and dig something useful to use against his previous employers to force them to give him the position he deserves – or at least, squeeze some money out of them.\\n\\nThe Neo-Samurai are not expecting to find another group of explorers, and are not likely to notice them from afar unless the crew drew attention to themselves. If the PCs listen in on Takao, whether from a distance or up close, they can hear him sparking the next several minutes admonishing his squad for expressing their fears of this place, reminding them of the “tenets of Bushidō”, with which they should steel their resolve. Takao makes his soldiers repeat the mission to him: to explore the large tunnel nearby and find “the coffin complex”.\\n\\n---\\n\\n5 // 1/05 Bulletin - Tokyo Othérscape\\nProperty of City of Mist.

While the crew deals with the swarm on their end, the Neo-Samurai fight in the background, but could come to the aid of the crew if they see someone in need; see the Challenge profile for how. If they do help this way, they give the entire crew indenbedt, which represents their expectation for gratitude and loyalty from the PC; this is what Kōjirō calls “honor”.\\n\\nAfter the fight, Takao will likely form a strong opinion about the crew, whether thankfulness for fighting side-by-side with them, awe at their greater combat abilities, or suspicion, if he was not aware of their presence before.\\n\\n## TSUKUMOGAMI SWARM ATTACK\\n\\n- **SMASH** 3\\n- **EXORCIZE** 3\\n\\n**LIMITS**\\n\\ndiscarded junk, mean, uneven terrain, three Scale Z collectives\\n\\n**LAST-MOMENT RESCUE:** When you deliver a Consequence to a PC from a tsukumogami, you may instead save Kōjiro or one of the ashirgar save the PC at the last moment.

This cave rises four stories tall, and most of it is occupied by a single circular building of gray concrete, which seemed to have been built into this natural cavity. Massive cables stretch all over along support arches built into the walls. Unused construction equipment sits abandoned. Whatever this building is, this side of it was never meant to be seen by the public.\\n\\nThere are no windows along the building’s walls, and no clear entrance.\\n\\nThe complex was built inside a small natural fissure that was widened to accommodate the construction. Much of the area was dug out to provide necessary space for the complex and to house the cables connecting the building to the outside world.\\n\\nThe original entrance, at surface level, was filled out with concrete when the place was abandoned. There’s only one other doorleading inside, a maintenance entrance half-hidden behind thick data cables.

There are one or two break rooms and meeting rooms, and a few rundown toilets.\\n\\nAll windows in the complex open into a central courtyard that used to have artificial grass and lighting, but Chizurka Kaiô has since covered most of the windows up with mountains of trash, dirt, and filth after making the courtyard his Forgotten Throne. All windows in the lower two floors are effectively blocked, as is the single door leading to the courtyard, but it’s possible to enter the courtyard through windows in the upper floors.\\n\\nEach coffin is a long-term-sustaining bed system with a neuro VR helmet. There are hundreds of these coffins, over dozens of rooms. Almost all of them are filled with dry, mummified corpses, who suffered from malnourishment, their bodies decaying after their brains fired in the power surge.

Furious due to their untimely death caused by the company’s exploitative ways, they will rip to shreds anyone associated with Matsuyama (a fact Takio will happily use against the crew to get his way), but can also be persuaded to help bring Matsuyama to justice. Use the On’yō (page 122) and the Funayurei-Haunted Office Complex (page 101) to represent these Challenges.\\n\\nA single working **Matsuyama hard drive** can be found in the upper floors of the complex – but it’ll run away the moment someone notices it. Chiri zuka Kaiō's presence has turned it into a tsukumogami with arms and legs. Stored within it are legal records, employee rosters, and logs of blueprints and emails that show a ludicrous amount of negligence during the facility’s construction. In the right (or wrong) hands, the records and codes in this hard drive could point to exploitable weaknesses in the company’s current operations. \\n\\nSearching the Coffin Complex is a Challenge.

He will then try to deceive them in order to get them out of the way, see the Challenge for details.\\n\\n## THE FORGOTTEN THRONE\\n\\nThe circular courtyard at the center of the complex is accessible only through open or broken windows at the top of ramps of dirt and trash, making the place look like a huge funnel. At the bottom, surrounded by yellowed artificial grass mostly covered by piles of junk, is a large throne made out of a dozen office chairs welded together.\\n\\nSitting in that throne is what looks like a red, hairy creature, an ogre-like yōkai no larger than a child, with a cracked golden crown atop his head. Biting his sharp claws in an unseemly manner, the creature greets you with a smile of even sharper teeth.\\n\\n“Welcome to my kingdom of castoffs, my dominion of debris, my territory of trash! I am King Chiri zuka Kaiō and you have entered my Forgotten Throne. Speak, surfaces. What brings you to my haven?”\\n\\nChiri zuka Kaiō sits on his throne with a fang-toothed grin. He is both regal yet crass, welcoming intruders with a booming voice one moment and then biting his toenails the next. He is wary of anyone who enters his kingdom well-armed, but is not immediately hostile.\\n\\nChiri zuka Kaiō’s main interest is in keeping the secrecy of his kingdom. He wants to be left alone, and to provide refuge for lost items and people (he sees little difference between the two). Whichever way the conversation progresses, the king will eventually demand the intruders – crew and Neo-Samurai alike if they’re present – to give him their word they will not speak of this haven to those who would exploit or destroy it.\\n\\nIf the **Matsuyama hard drive** escaped here, or if the crew didn’t look for it, it casually climbs atop Chiri zuka Kaiō’s shoulder when they approach. If the crew asks for the hard drive, Chiri zuka Kaiō will initially refuse. He does not look kindly on surfacers taking a tsukumogami away from his haven. However, if the crew treats the hard drive with kindness or respect, the king can be persuaded to release his hold on the drive and give his blessing.\\n\\nIf Kojiro Takao arrived here first, he and his ashigaru are **surrounded** by tsukumogami, their weapons raised. Even if the crew makes it clear that the crew is disturbed and angry at the situation, he only sees a yōkai that can turn technology into other yōkai, and that keeps his treasure from him, or in other words – a threat. He demands Chiri zuka Kaiō swear fealty to their Emperor, and when he obviously doesn’t, the Neo-Samurai see no other option but to destroy him.\\n\\nIn short, Kojiro pushes for a fight.

Alternatively, you can push the NPCs to the background, so if the crew fights against Chiri zuka Kaiō, the Neo-Samurai will handle swarms of tsukumogami, or if fighting for Chiri zuka Kaiō, he will sit back in his throne and watch as his trash fights for him.\\n\\nThe Forgotten Throne is Thin Place, with a **Mythos-strengthening aura**.\", content_length=4551, page=270), Page(content=\"# BOONS OF THE FORGOTTEN THRONE\\nIf the crew sides with Chiriizuka Kaiō and promise to keep his domain a secret, they are welcome to come and go as they please.

The company was a world-wide pioneer in the use of nanotech in the medical field, but their long-term goals were to use nanites as a part of large scale geoengineering projects, changing entire biomes to address the havoc caused by a worsening climate.\\n\\nWhile their ideals were praise-worthy, their security and professionalism was not, resulting in the Nanotech Disaster (page 14): an experimental form of nanite was released outside Kenko’s remote mountain lab, spreading uncontrollably, transforming living and nonliving matter. (This is the way history tells it today; it’s possible some other cause altogether is to blame.)\\n\\nCountless lives perished in the disaster and billions of credits were spent in the containment efforts. The entire government shifted gears into an emergency state, with the Nano-butai granted virtually unlimited authority to deal with the problem. No environmental disaster has ever reached the kind of scale seen in what later came to be called the Kuroi Yogore (“black stain”), and the land around it came to be known as Meido (page 34). Severe restrictions were placed on research concerning nanotechnology and geoengineering.\\n\\n# TEMPLE OF THE YAKUBYŌ GAMI\\n\\nToday the nanotech facility serves as the main temple of the Yakubyō Gami plague spirits and a home base for their Roamers (page 236). No one else is allowed, and indeed, most wanderers avoid the place like the plague. There are two exceptions to this rule.\\n\\nFirst are wanna-be Roamers. When one seeks to join the Roamers, the newcomer is sent to train in “temples” across the disaster area until they are ready to be initiated by the spirit masters themselves. The Roamer then travels to the nanotech facility ruins, where the Yakubyō Gami infect them with the broken nanites of the disaster zone, twisted by their own plague-based magics. When they exit the temple, the Roamers’ leader Nozawa Emiko welcomes them to the fold. They then join the outlanders, spreading plague to “punish the wicked” – as judged according to the inhumane moral compass of the Yakubyō Gami.\\n\\nThe second is the Deactivation Unit (DU) of the Nano-butai.

Saji has a reputation as a fair dealer, if a bit shady in terms of his associations. He approached the crew because of a rumor that the DU are on their way to the Kenko facility, to “ruin” this treasure trove for the likes of Saji. He does not candidly share this information with the crew, so as not to spook them off; the Nano-butai's slash-and-burn reputation precedes them.\\n\\n- A friend or crew member becomes afflicted by a malady that cannot be treated, or a piece of land owned by the crew or a loved one is polluted beyond the point of no return. They come to learn there’s a solution to these problems, which is unfortunately also the chief contributor for the Nanotech Disaster: the Kenko nano gel, capable of unparalleled feats of bio- and geo-engineering. If any gel containers remain, they will be in the facility.\\n\\n- One of the crew members seeks a new Source or to join the Roamers, or one of the crew might have underlying issues with the Roamers, after they killed a loved one who lives in the wastes.\\n\\n- One of the crew members is a current or retired member of the Nano-butai and receives a call or distress signal from Teshima Osamu, as the latter is stomped in the face of the supernatural Yakubyō Gami and cannot hope to complete the decontamination of the Kuroi Yogore without a Sourcer's help.\\n\\n## LAYOUT\\n\\n- Reaching The Ruins\\n- The Journey Through Meido\\n- Blackened Battlements\\n- Exploring The Ruins\\n- The Data Center\\n- The Domes\\n- The Spire\\n- The Boardroom\\n\\n## SALVAGE OPERATION\\n\\nThere is plenty of loot for the crew to dig up out of the debris and ashes in the Kenko ruins, if they are adept at scavenging and salvaging. The best and most valuable piece of salvage around is the single remaining canister of pure nano gel, which is at the Yakubyō Gami shrine (Boardroom). To get it, the crew will have to either assist the Roamers against the DU’s incursion or destroy the kami with the DU's help (although the DU is unlikely to let them walk away with any nanotech). Or perhaps they just grab anything not bolted down and run away.\\n\\n## NANITE EXPOSURE\\n\\nOnce a PC has been exposed to nanites, you may give the character itchy-skin-1 as a Consequence at any point, especially if some time passes. This status can be mitigated with appropriate protection, such as nano-resistant tech and clothing, and relevant Source-powered blessings and wards such as those of the Yamabushi, page 275.\\n\\nThe symptom status can be Restore with appropriate care, but the infection cannot be cured without specialized nanotech or Source-touched care; in the presence of such advanced tools, removing the infection entirely requires a quick outcome, or an Extra Feat while Restoring the symptoms status. As long as they are infected, an infected PC may continue to be afflicted by the itchy-skin-1 Consequence (or worse).\\n\\nAn untreated nanite infection can be lethal. At itchy-skin-1, the body begins to change at a molecular level, but its defenses are still holding strong.

But no, Meido is very much on Earth, a stark reminder of what technology can do when it is unleashed against nature, even inadvertently.

Actions taken to learn about the wastes can reveal the importance of environmental suits and preventative meds such as anti-rads and anti-fungal measures. Such actions can also reveal the existence of the Yakubyō Gami Roamers and their “Roamer Justice” (page 236), as they are considered to be the foremost threat - or bringers of order, depends on who you ask - in and around the Kuroi Yogore.\\n\\nDepending on your cinematic considerations, you can play out the journey through Meido in a few ways:\\n\\n- Fast forward the journey by simply describing it and then moving on to the encounter with the Yamabushi.\\n- Establish the journey scene and make a single Threat from the Meido Challenge profile. See how the PCs react and then potentially deliver one Consequence before moving on.\\n- Ask the PCs for a quick outcome roll to reflect their travel. They must succeed in order to arrive. Deliver Consequences as named from the Challenge profile.\\n- Play the travel scene as a complete tracked Challenge; the PCs arrive when they know not **traverse**. \\n\\n### YAMABUSHI ON THE ROAD\\n\\nYou come across a group of two dozen travelers walking single file towards what looks like an ancient line of small shrines along the ridgeline. While they are carrying weapons and equipment needed for surviving in the wastes, something about their demeanor seems elegant, even unearthly. They all seem to be wearing sashes adorned with bright-red pom-poms, a telltale sign of the mountain ascetics.\\n\\nAt a point of your choosing on the road to the Kuroi Yogore and the Kenko facility within, the crew come across wandering Yamabushi, led by an ancient monk named Daichi. He is courteous but cautious with strangers, presenting his group as “wanderers” and nothing more, since many in the Megacity covet the Yamabushi’s magical secrets. He carefully asks why city folk are traveling so far from the Megacity. The monks **shun the Noise**, which affects every interaction by a character whose Noise themes are visible in any way. They appreciate honesty, and are willing to trade information if the crew shares their mission. If their trust is gained, they will reveal themselves as Yamabushi pilgrims who test themselves against the dangers of the wastes. They are able to survive due to special prayers they make to the kami and their strict purification regimes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n_Property of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield.

The nanotech cloud is in fact a minuscule battlefield, two sides in a constant fight: the Kenko nanobots against the Nano-butai's countering nanotech. The sparkles are microscopic electrical surges and reflections of high intensity laser-like weapons used by the tiny bots. Both sides routinely reinforce their forces by collecting minuscule debris from the air and assembling new copies, and are expected to wear themselves out only in several hundred years. As the nanites battle and destroy one another, they produce an ashy cloud that wafts off whenever the wind picks up.\\n\\n## PASSING THE WALL\\nBreaking the wall is virtually impossible, even with military grade explosives, as they have reinforced-5 and a destroy-5 Limit. The crew is likely to run out of ammo or get the Kenko Boundary Security System to trigger. Attempts to fly over the walls are resisted by the present nano swarm and require a roll with a hindering Scale 4 nanite cloud, with failure resulting in nanite exposure and a danger-mess-6 limit (see Nanite Exposure, page 274).\\n\\nThe following ways to enter the zone can be discovered with an action, with a possible Consequence of triggering the Boundary Security due to snooping around. It might also be triggered by attempts to use the points of entry, particularly if the crew are not being stealthy.\\n\\n- The most obvious entrance is a large metal gate with giant “41” written on it in white, now smudged with ash. The gate can be opened by directly hacking the system’s hack-2 limit, but it is firewalled-2. It’s easier to just activate the gate hydraulics directly (activate-2). Logs can show that the gate was recently opened, after many years of inactivity, by Teshima Osamu, head of the Deactivation Unit.\\n  \\n- A huge red tree, horrifically transformed, has grown over and through a part of the wall, creating an access point through the nanite swarm. Its bark appears to have veins which pump a kind of blood-like sap up to its crimson foliage. A character who climbs the tree to reach the other side of the wall will be hindered by its sticky veins. As a consequence, the character may get stuck-3. The tree attempts to absorb all stuck characters into itself, causing absorbed-into-tree-3. To make this encounter longer and more dangerous, make this tree into a Jubokko (page 106).\\n\\n## THE BLACKENED BATTLEMENTS\\nIn the heart of the Kuroi Yogore lies a nameless mountain, upon which the Kenko Research Facility was built. Kilometers of wall surround the forbidden site, circling the mountain’s base and blocking all access. Made out of military grade smart concrete and composite carbon steel, the walls are virtually indestructible. Every surface is covered with thick black ash, bearing the scars of the infamous disaster. \\n\\nAnd yet the fight is not done. Rising above the wall and surrounding this outer perimeter is a hazy cloud of nanites, hanging in the air, sparkling with activity.\\n\\nAs the crew comes closer to the walls of the site, the presence of the nanites becomes ubiquitous. A buzz fills the air, unending sparks fill the sky, and the tiny machine's presence can even be felt on the skin like an itch that grows in intensity until the flesh feels as if it’s on fire.\\n\\nNear the wall and all over the facility grounds, PCs are exposed to ambient clouds of nanites, some of whom may begin to attempt to transform the PCs. See Nanite Exposure (page 274).\", content_length=3577, page=276), Page(content=\"- The least obvious entrance is the one used by the Roamers to traffic in and out of the facility, a long dark drainage passage. They do not appreciate intruders, and as such, the tunnel is boobytrapped in three places. Traversing each of its sections safely - start, middle, and end - requires a careful pathfinding action with a quick outcome that can set off a trap as Consequences (walking through without heed sets off the Consequences anyway, as the Threat is implicit). The first trap is a spring trap that launches a metal spike at the target (wounded-3). The second is a pitfall trap leading into a pitch-black, filthy pit filled neck-high with toxic waste (trapped-in-hole-4 and Sickened-4). The third is a magical-wand-3 made of dozens of strangely-greasy ofuda paper strips, repelling any who are not Touched by the Yakubyō Gami.

They have adopted some prayers and fashioned some protective talismans, but they don't truly know how to face yōkai, and their methods of attacking the issue are entirely technical.

Solar panels keep the lights going and some of the servers operational, but there’s no network connection with the outside world.\\n\\nInside, at first it appears that there are no human remains, just the personal effects left by workers that serve as a haunting preservation of work culture at that time. However, under the layers of black nanite ash are clothes filled with yet more black ash that are the final remains of workers utterly consumed by the nanites they unleashed. All evidence suggests the building was evacuated with very little warning, and has seen little activity since. The Roamers avoid the data center, it means little to them.\\n\\nMost of the data center’s equipment remains. If the crew could access the system and bypass the firewall-3 they could download valuable information; if they simply grab storage devices whole cloth, the data is encrypted-3 and there’s a good chance the particular storage device they picked won’t hold anything interesting.\\n\\n#### DATA FROM THE CENTER\\n- Kenko bioengineering research data, kept secret from the public. Many corporations, especially in the medical and pharmaceutical field (such as Soma Medical, page 192), would kill for any substantial portion of Kenko’s research.  \\n- Damning reports that suggest that the government was fully aware of the geo-engineering project and its significant risks.  \\n- A final query in the system before all operations shut down, requesting the location and status of the four cylinders of raw, un-programmed nano gel. The un-read reply indicates that three were emptied the day of the disaster, but that the fourth cylinder was sent to the executives in the Boardroom, inside the Spire.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# THE DOMES\\nFour interconnected domes cover the mountain’s slope like mushroom caps. Using the most advanced systems in agricultural informatics, 3D fabrication, and automated hydroponics, the domes were said to be able to replicate any environment found on Earth, in order to study and develop nanotech solutions fitting its climate.\\n\\nIn the time since the accident, the environments inside the domes have become truly wild. The unchecked power of the nanites and the preserving power of the domes’ environmental algorithms facilitated the creation of dangerous new ecosystems. Plants that spray clouds of digestive enzymes capable of dissolving organic tissues; insects that are too large, or combine traits of several different species; chitinous blades of grass that follow the direction of animals that walk by.\\n\\nEach dome has its own dangers. The Roamers can sometimes be found here, as they use the domes to test themselves, harvest materials, and for meditation.\\n\\n### DOME ONE: TROPICAL RAINFOREST\\nThis dome has a broken roof, and the thick humidity within offers no view of the stars and trees outside of its walls of mist. The dome is full of towering tropical trees that have become tangled together with exotic birds. The trees thus sprout colorful feathers and screech in horror. The ground is dangerous here, as the surprisingly strong claw-like roots of the dying trees can grasp at intruders (rooted-3) and eventually try to squish the body into fertilizer (squished-3).\\n\\n### DOME TWO: THE CAVE\\nAn artificial cave environment constructed from laser-cut stone. The wet walls are covered in phosphorescentfungal life, giving the dome a blue-green glow. The environment smells terribly, but despite appearances, nothing here is actually toxic. Characters who spend more than a few minutes breathing in the air here take glowing-organs-3 as their very bodies become light sources. If the status is not removed within a day the effect becomes long-lasting and the character replaces it with a story tag glowing organs.\\n\\n### DOME THREE: THE PANDA RESERVES\\nWhat was once a calm environment of stone, dirt, grass, and bamboo is now overgrown to the point of impassability. Hiding in the grass are red-haired Mutant Red Pandas, growling at the crew.\\n\\nOnce a symbol of cute fun, these dog-sized creatures have turned deadly.

The waters are murky with the ash of destroyed nanites, but it quickly becomes clear that something swims under the surface. Probing the lake or even standing close to it for too long will provoke the mutated **Giant Koi Fish** inside. The Koi Fish is beautiful, but humongous in size – large enough to swallow a person whole.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# THE CONTROL CHAMBER\\nThe Lake Dome holds the environmental controls for all of them, in a hidden chamber at the back. Finding and opening the sealed-off control chamber requires an action.\\n\\nInside the chamber, all the processes of the environmental systems can be monitored from an independent network setup exclusive to the Domes. Hacking this system (firewalled-2) reveals that the nanotech disaster began in Dome One, an accident caused by a sanctioned experiment where the nano gel was programmed and introduced to the environment to test its capacity to revive an ecosystem. When the nanites got out of hand, the scientists attempted to use the Dome’s systems to stop the nanites, but this only spread them further. This caused the release of the second and third cylinders of nano gel, but not the fourth, which was sent to somewhere in the **Spire**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# MUTANT RED PANDA\\n**HURT OR SUBDUE** 3  \\n**LIMITS**  \\ncunning, cute  \\n**TAGS & STATUSES**  \\n\\n**THREATS / CONSEQUENCES**  \\n- Raise tail up threateningly  \\n  - Spray venomous barbed quills (necrosis-3 to everyone in the area)  \\n- Scurry up a tree  \\n  - Leap onto a target's face and grab tight (clawed-2 and red-panda-on-face-3)  \\n- Bark and squeal cutely  \\n  - More red pandas appear from a hidden grotto (increase scale by one)  \\n  - The pandas employ clever pack tactics to close in on their prey (cornered-3) or gain a superior position-2  \\n\\n---\\n\\n# THE SPIRE\\nThis glass and steel tower, rising next to the mountain’s peak, was once the global headquarters of Kenko, a symbol of the power and reach of the corporation. As you look upon it today, it symbolizes the reverse: the folly, hubris, and filth of humanity. Its current tenants, both nairite and human, have transformed its interior such that it bears only surface resemblance to the heyday of Kenko. The walls are part-broken, part-digested; rusting furniture is stacked in piles; dirty nets full of salvage hang everywhere; mounds of nano-waste ash cover the floors. And yet the Roamers have made this place feel like a true temple: They have transformed the tower into a monastery to their dark kami.\\n\\nThe Spire is the headquarters of former Kenko, converted into the Roamers’ central temple: Offices have become isolation cells, conference rooms have become training dojos or barracks, and the hall’s are packed full of scavenged supplies from around the wastes.\\n\\nIf the crew attack the Spire, movement through it will require completing the Up the Spire Challenge.

At this height, the boardroom should have been buffeted by powerful gusts, but instead the atmosphere here is still and dreary, heavy with the panoramic views of empty land, ravaged by disaster. Upon the once-plush stone conference table, now grimy and covered with stolen and defiled relics from across Meido, a priestess of the Roamers is prostrating herself in prayer to her vile gods. Something malign moves through the stale air. Suddenly, you feel the urge to vomit.\\n\\nThe Roamers have torn away the corporate art and technology that used to furnish this room. Reformed as a place of worship, silk hangings and other shrine treasures decorate the main shrine for the Yakubyō Gami. Knowledgeable persons might recognize some of these as cultural objects of great importance from days gone by, belonging to the worship of sacred places for honor and the wastes for their spirit nurses. Behind the stone table in the room is a heavily sealed case marked with a litany of warnings, in which is the remaining container of unprogrammed nanites dating from the original days of Kenko (see sidebar).\\n\\nKneeling in prayer upon the long stone boardroom table is **Nozawa Emiko**, the leader of the Roamers. She wears tattered wasteland clothes with heavy dust goggles hung around her neck. As the crew enters, she remains kneeling up on the table.\\n\\nA haze ripples in the middle of the room, and a cold breeze blows through as if standing on the tall peak of a mountain; it is in fact coming from the shima (kami islands, page 33) the Yakubyō Gami inhabit, beyond little cracks in reality; in a few years, this will be a proper Thin Place. The kami themselves are not there, but their mystical presence is, allowing the Roamers and the crew to interact with them.\\n\\nUnless the crew have never committed a transgression against someone else (an unlikely event given their mercenary professions), the Yakubyō Gami grow restless-2 and demand Nozawa banish them from their presence. This happens even if they are accompanied by Mōjin, and even if he had them go through a purification ritual – the kami suffer no evil in their presence.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhat happens next depends on what the crew is here to do:\\n\\n- If the crew wants to get the nano gel from Nozawa she is apprehensive, knowing full well what an incredible bargaining chip it is. She can be swayed if the crew proves themselves trustworthy and willing to take action. Nozawa asks them to do a job for her: infect an elusive target that’s out of reach for the Roamers (an important figure who escaped to the Megacity) or deactivate the defenses of a wastelands settlement that shored themselves up against the Roamers. At the end of that job, she delivers the nano gel to the crew and possibly invites them to join the Roamers.\\n\\n- If the crew is here with Teshima Osamu, or unwilling to help the Roamers, they must fight their way to the nano gel case or steal it from under the Yakubyō Gami noses. The kami’s presence is pervading the room, but their attention is limited – a big distraction can give someone a chance to slip by and grab the case.\\n\\n# THE LAST NANO GEL CANISTER\\n\\nA suspension of nanites in a programmable gel, the contents of the last nano gel canister is super-agent capable of incredible acts of transformation. In the hands of a capable scientist or tinkerer, it can perform nothing short of miracles – or horrors.\\n\\nRather than representing it with Effects, treat this last canister as a plot device. Not only can it be used to create a major transformation directly, but it can also be traded for virtually anything, making it a golden ticket to any single thing, person, or service the PCs wish for, albeit not without complications.\\n\\nUnfortunately, as the Tokyo Megacity has learned the hard way, deploying nanites can often backfire. If you still want to roll for the outcome, use **Going Out In A Blaze**. Or, if the Threat of nanotech has been made sufficiently clear during this job, you can simply deliver the Consequences when the PCs use the nano gel to make the Future Breaker, or worse.\\n\\nThere is also the issue of the Nano-butt canning after whoever possesses or even previously handled the canister. This time it won’t be Teshima Osamu’s world-wary outland team, but the Megacity’s Nano-buttai, who are more concerned with holding power than actually stopping the spread of dangerous nanotech. You can use Challenges such as the Nano-buttai Trooper (page 128) as well as a wide range of tanks, drones, weapon plant forms, and all the armaments government money can buy.', content_length=4749, page=283), Page(content=\"# THE YAKUBYŌ GAMI\\n\\nThe Yakubyō Gami are spirits of pestilence and disease. They come in many kinds and shapes, and would usually travel the world and inflict sorrow and woe on anyone who transgressed on social norms, but currently most of them are inside a kami island that touches the Boardroom.\\n\\nThe Yakubyō Gami have traditionally taken on the role of judges, doling out punishment to those who behave wickedly, but as inhuman kami, they have little concern for circumstance or mortals' obsession with fairness. In the wake of the Nanotech Disaster, they were driven to the Spire, to the death and corruption that permeated the area. The shrine built by the Roamers has only strengthened their hold in the mortal world, but they seem content not to venture out themselves, instead letting the Roamers be their agents in this new world.\\n\\nThe Yakubyō Gami challenge represents the mystical presence of the Yakubyō Gami in the Boardroom, inhabiting the nanotech in the air. Technologies that fight nanotechnology are therefore effective against them, and count on the same Limit as **banish**. To face the kami fully, one would need to find a way to enter their shima or coax them out of it, and then come to blows with some of the most feared kami in Japanese history – beyond being somewhat detrimental to one's health, it is also beyond the scope of this job.\\n\\n### YAKUBYŌ GAMI\\n\\n#### LIMITS\\n**banish 5**\\n\\n- kami of pestilence, mystically-entrenched-3, Scale 1\\n\\n#### THREATS & CONSEQUENCES\\n- **Icy fog from the spirit world rolls in**\\n  - Invoke feelings of guilt for past acts (guilt-ridden-3)\\n  - Inflict visions of the target suffering from the disease or ailment that terrifies them most (terrified-4)\\n- **Sparkles in the air indicate nanites are on the move**\\n  - The nanites infect someone’s limb (rotting-limb-4)\\n  - The nanites descend on a piece of gear with carbon or biological parts and run it (burn a tag)\\n\\n- Nozawa Emiko falls on her knees, eyes wide\\n  - Nanites leave Nozawa Emiko as the Yakubyō Gami take her life force to reinforce their presence (remove three tiers from banish and deal drained-2 to Emiko)\\n\\n---\\n\\n# NOZAWA EMIKO\\n\\nThe leader of the Yakubyō Gami Roamers, Nozawa is a hardened survivor who cares greatly for her people.

She carries an air of authority around her, and is willing to negotiate with the crew if they have something she wants. She believes the Roamers are nothing less than the moral core upon which the entire Meido rests, and that while the Yakubyō Gami aren’t necessarily always correct, it’s better to adhere to their demands than to have the alternative – unending chaos.\\n\\n### NOZAWA EMIKO\\n\\n#### LIMITS\\n**hurt or subdue 4**  \\n**persuade 4**\\n\\n- makeshift Roamer armor, grim, shielded-by-nanites-2, true-believer-4, warded-2\\n\\n#### SPECIALS\\n**HARBINGER OF DISEASE:** Touching or attacking Nozawa at close range inflicts caught-in-2, fever-2, or shaking-2.\\n\\n- Grip her makeshift spear tightly\\n  - Expertly stab with her makeshift spear (cut-up-3 and septic-wound-2)\\n  \\n- Furrow her brow in grim determination\\n  - Give a final, harrowing warning of coming death (intimidated-3)\\n  - Convince someone that the Yakubyō Gami are what’s holding Meido together or the only way to truly control nanotech (listen-2 or listening-2)\\n\\n- Call upon the spirits of pestilence to aid her\\n  - Cast a plague upon a target (sickness-3)\\n  - Utter a prayer for the nanite cloud to repair itself (gain shielded-by-nanites-2 or the Roamers (remove up to 3 tiers of harm statuses))\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Property of City of Mist.

As they grew in ambition and upgraded to smuggling, they took over a dilapidated sentō in their turf and put cash into renovating it into a nightclub, creating their own criminal headquarters and hangout.\\n\\nIt still has hot water baths in communal pools, but now the place is lit only with neon and its halls are filled with club music blasting loud, protecting the criminals inside from cybernetic ears that might pick up on their dealings.\\n\\nIn order to accomplish these changes, the Yuna were forced to bargain with a somewhat dangerous yōkai that inhabits a small shrine hidden within the sentō – a mizuchi (water dragon/spirit). It made itself known to the leader of the Yuna, Kobayashi Tomoko, who agreed to allow the mizuchi access to their customers – so it could drain the life energy from them – so long as it acted with subtlety and did not make itself seen. The mizuchi agreed, and must now remain in its shrine, kill no visitors, and speak only in whispers. Tomoko agreed in the name of all the Yuna, to not discuss the mizuchi with others and to leave it be.\\n\\nThe club became popular and business has gone up as the gang has become more successful in their smuggling operations. This attracted the attention of black market rivals – namely the Ghost Market. They contacted the Yuna gang, suggesting that they have a chat over business, an invitation that felt more like a threat. The Yuna reluctantly agreed. With little time to plan, they reached out to the PC crew as hired mercs, to serve as muscle and help them in dealing with the Ghost Market middle managers.\\n\\n## JOB BRIEFING\\nThe infamously exclusive Ghost Market (page 159), the Megacity’s roving AR black market, has come to a nearby neighborhood and you’ve been invited… to work. Your job is to act as facilitators for what will likely be a tense negotiation between a small-time syndicate and the much more established Ghost Market elite.\\n\\nYour employers are a smuggler gang called the Yuna (“bathhouse girls”), a female-led operation that trades in smuggled weapons and stolen pharmaceuticals out of their sentō (page 37) which has been converted into a stylish night club. They’ve called you to act both as negotiators and as backup muscle to help them during a meeting with Ghost Market leaders to determine their future in the larger Tokyo underworld. Your job will be successful if you can make sure the Yuna remain unharmed, and come out of their negotiations on top.\\n\\nYour contact is a Yuna named Choko, who has asked that you come to the sentō before the meeting. Rumor has it that the bathhouse is haunted by a kami or yōkai, which could complicate the negotiations – especially since it’s unclear if the gang is even aware of the possible danger.\\n\\n## THE YUNA GANG\\nThe Yuna use the Bōsōzoku Rider profile (page 124). They all wear the gang’s color, a distinctive shade of yellow-green neon, usually over their cyberware. All Yuna are under a magical binding which keeps them from talking about the mizuchi with outsiders or directly betraying it. This takes the form of a **sporter-promise** status. Yuna members who are deep in the Noise, as most of them are, simply talk around the subject, changing conversation topics without realizing they’re doing it.\\n\\nThe crew’s contact is Choko (a cup for serving sake), who no longer uses her real name, Nagasawa Jun, since she left her birth family on bad terms. Young and brash, Choko isn’t stupid, but she’s easily distracted, constantly monitoring her AR feed, occasionally sending messages, or watching some vid. Choko wears a holographic dress that floats about her, projected from her mostly aesthetic cyberware, and wears on her shoulder a face mask identical in shape to that of a famous Kawaii Mask Streamer (page 232), which she “watches ironically”.', content_length=3954, page=287), Page(content=\"Kobayashi Tomoko is the Yuna leader, a 30-something woman with a clearly botched bio-hair implant that makes her look as if she has a dirty mane, yet she wears it with pride, as if urging people to ask about it. Formerly a test subject for hire, a job just as terrible as it sounds, Tomoko joined the Yuna when she could no longer stand having other people control her and her body. She became the Yuna leader through ambition mixed with willingness to compromise; she cares too much for her girls to allow them to keep being a small-time nuisance in some neglected part of town.\\n\\nTomoko is absent at the beginning of the night. In an attempt to appear more impressive she upgraded her cyberware earlier that day, but the process had some complications. She appears only when the deal is almost closed, on heavy painkillers.\\n\\n# WAIT, WHAT’S THE GHOST MARKET?\\nIf your group hasn't played through A Bridge Too Far (page 296) and haven't encountered the Ghost Market in the past, they might need to learn about it first, possibly by asking contacts or searching online. They can also ask the Yuna to arrange for them a provisional, one-time invitation to the Market. By doing this, the crew's reputation becomes entwined with the Yuna – should the Yuna be accepted into the Market, the crew is welcome to attend in the future. Otherwise… well, better do something that really impresses the Market's overseers.\\n\\n# HOOKS\\n- One of the crew's close friends is a member of the Yuna, directly connected to them, or benefits from their rising success. Once the Yuna get the Ghost Market's semi-ultimate, this contact approaches the crew and offers to connect them with the Yuna.\\n\\n- The Yuna have worked with the crew before, perhaps they provided some useful loadout items in the past. Now that they’re feeling they’re in over their heads with the Ghost Market, they contact the crew and ask for help, in exchange for future discounts and favors.\\n\\n- The crew are known for being good negotiators or facilitators, thanks to how they handled a previous job or due to the reputation of one of them. Even “pretty good” is good enough for the Yuna, who feel they need an outsider’s help in the negotiations.\\n\\n# LAYOUT\\n- The Neighborhood\\n- Entrance to the Sentō Club\\n- The Washrooms\\n- The Baths\\n- The Hidden Shrine\\n- The Back Rooms\\n\\n# THE NIGHT’S ITINERARY\\n- Seiryu Arrives\\n- The Enforcers Arrive\\n- The Negotiations\\n\\n# BOTCHED DIPLOMACY\\nEnsuring that the meeting between the Yuna smugglers and the Ghost Market reps goes well is the primary responsibility of the crew. They must walk a fine line here, as they are expected to serve as muscle and protect the Yuna, but they must also keep from letting a fight break out. Should they fail the latter task, they risk the diplomatic upheavals going sour, which harms their own reputation and imperils the summit.\\n\\nDuring the evening, track the botched-diplomacy status, which the whole crew shares. It hinders their interactions with members of the Ghost Market, and therefore has a direct effect on the final steps of the negotiation. At tier 5, the crew is no longer allowed to participate directly in the negotiations, although they can still advise the Yuna or employ some secret shenanigans. At tier 6, the crew fails the Yuna and are dismissed from the job.\\n\\nThis status has a potential to show up at a number of points during the job. Impose botched-diplomacy-1 on the crew if the PCs flout security, try to bring weapons into the baths, or otherwise cause trouble rather than stop it. Acts of deference, de-escalating violence, or finding middle ground might reduce it. Much of the latter part of the job, during the negotiation itself, requires the crew to avoid getting this status while also finding ways to reduce it.\", content_length=3759, page=288), Page(content=\"# THE SENTO AND NEIGHBORHOOD\\n\\n## THE NEIGHBORHOOD\\n\\nThis older neighborhood has seen better days.

Giant open-air reservoirs, once part of a sprawling drainage system, are now filled with mountains of garbage where birds nest. It seems like many years ago the monsoons, much like most of the people, decided to move to other parts of the Megacity.\\n\\nA jumble of cables above connects between the buildings on both sides of the streets - electricity and cyberspace flowing above, while you can hear the sewage running not too far behind some alley. This is what a neighborhood looks like when criminal gangs take over municipal operations.\\n\\nEvery corner has a liquor store, gun store, or pawn shop and it’s hard to miss the sizable homeless population in the alleyways. Even though some buildings stand deserted, squatters avoid them, as they might not keep standing for much longer.\\n\\nThe Yuna girls would appear to be more focused on their criminal enterprises and their sentō than on community relations.\\n\\nAs the crew make their way through the neighborhood, their contact Choko calls and catches up with them in one of the alleys. She’s dressed in her gang’s color - a shade of yellow-green neon. Even her cybernetics have sizable plastic parts in these colors, and the graffiti on every building corner echoes the motif. It should be clear that despite being alone, with strangers, in the middle of a dark alley - Choko feels safe. The Yuna own this neighborhood.\\n\\nChoko gives a respectable bow and asks the crew to join her at an outdoor table in front of a tea shop. She pays respect to a small shrine next to the entrance, then waves at the waiter to order the shop's famous ice tea for everyone, telling him to put it on the Yuna's tab. His demeanor reveals that there’s no such thing, yet he says nothing.\\n\\n## HAPHAZARD BRIEFING\\n\\nChoko suggests the crew be on the lookout for the Ghost Market’s envoy, a woman named Seiryū who is supposed to be coming before the main negotiation to ensure everything is going smoothly. A PC who has some familiarity with the Ghost Market might know (or Discover) that Seiryū is a very dangerous individual - as befitting the public face of the dreaded Ghost Market - and Choko doesn’t show enough respect when mentioning her.\\n\\nChoko can answer any major questions the PCs have. If they ask her about the yōkai that is rumored to inhabit the sentō, she will snort and deny anything mythic going on there. Too deep in the Noise, she is unaware of the spirit and shows open bemusement if any PC seems to take the rumor seriously. However, even though she doesn’t realize it, she is still under the effect of the magical binding. She is unable to talk about the Hidden Shrine, even though she suspects Tomoko hides some secret there.\\n\\n## PLANNING THE NEGOTIATIONS\\n\\nThe PCs will likely want to figure out where in the club is best to set up the meeting. Choko has no map to give them (“Why do you need a map? It’s three baths and some rooms”) and suggests to hold the meeting in the Baths (“It’s our thing, they’re gonna love it!”), despite it being full of club goers and full of loud music; Choko sees these as added layers of security. Other options include the Backrooms and the Hidden Shrine (should the crew discover it).\\n\\nRegarding security measures, she sets a few Yuna bouncers, but that’s about it. Most Yuna have cybernetics and the skills to defend themselves if a fight goes down, but they’re hoping the PCs will be their main muscle. Choko believes Kobayashi Tomiko will grant the PCs access to the club’s cyberspace Domain and all security cameras and chatter, but that’s ultimately for Tomoko to decide. Unbeknown to Choko or the characters, Tomoko is not going to appear in time to even participate in the night’s events.\\n\\n## ENTRANCE TO THE SENTŌ CLUB\\n\\nFrom the outside, the Sentō Club looks like someone built a nightclub out of a traditional Japanese bathhouse, which is in fact the truth. Swooping gables are underlit with blacklights and flashing facsimiles of paper lanterns. The ground shakes from the pounding bass of the music pumped inside. The smell of scented hot water fills the air, alongside the caustic fragrance of cheap perfume. Neon Argons along the floor guide the long line of waiting patrons through a small rock garden and toward the main entrance.\\n\\nA beefy chrome-dusted Yuna bouncer, Hase Ri (with the Street Fighting Power Set, page 135), stands right inside the building, on its elegant wooden floor. Covered head to toe\", content_length=4581, page=289), Page(content='in the neon gang color, she gives the crew a careful look, but doesn’t examine them too closely, as they\\'re expected and honored guests. They can easily enter, evoking grunts of disapproval from those waiting in line.\\n\\nTHE CLUB IN CYBERSPACE  \\nThe Yuna gang are no fools, and they invested in a simple yet effective VR security system, an EpiS Tar Pit. The club\\'s Domain shares a surface similarity with its real-world counterpart, with all of the core systems hidden beneath the baths, under a thick layer of tar. There’s no backdoor to allow one to reach these systems, and even the Yuna would need to dig through in order to reach them. Their assumption is that there’s no need for anyone to be able to access these day-to-day systems, as everything is running smoothly on its own.\\n\\nHackers trying to breach the layer of tar have to dig through thick-tar-4. Consequences can create system disruptions in the club as uncareful diggers accidentally damage the lines representing power and maintenance channels. The Yuna have a drill app for getting through the security, but they’re reliant to give it to the crew without permission from Kobayashi Tomoko.\\n\\nGaining access to the core systems grants the hacker superuser status, allowing them to see and hear every room in the nightclub (including the hidden shrine) and to easily access all transmissions running through its Domain.\\n\\nTHE WASHROOMS  \\nAfter passing the lobby, the club splits into sides segregated by gender, with men’s and women’s restrooms and showers. This unusual setup for a nightclub seems to be exactly what the patrons are looking for, the experience they paid for. Excited, they enter their allotted side and simply strip down with each other, although many keep to the bare minimum of decency. Non-binary people are welcome to choose, and no one would really care if someone enters the “wrong” side - it’s all a show, deliberately old-fashioned, a nostalgic trip to a past none of these people lived through.\\n\\nAs more savvy visitors, you realize that this setup has the added quirk preventing anyone from entering the main club floor with hidden weapons.\\n\\nThe crew can’t bring their heavy equipment, armor, or weapons with them into the baths without doing so in an obvious and socially unacceptable way, earning contempt from the club goers and batched-diplomacy-1 [see sidebar].\\n\\nThey could try to hide a weapon under a towel, or assert one’s authority as members of the club’s security team, but otherwise all such tags are burned. Cyberware and gear hidden inside cyber limbs get a free pass.\\n\\nThese washrooms are filled with criminal types. Some who were drawn by rumors of the Ghost Market are here for the very first time and are looking to test the limits of the club’s security. If they have reason to think the PCs are working for the Yuna gangsters, the washrooms are a great place to assert their street cred by starting a fight. In this case, have a Gang Member (Metro: Otherrsape, page 306) or three make some noise and swing their bravado around, providing the crew with another opportunity to get some batched-diplomacy-1.\\n\\nTHE BATHS  \\nThe largest room in the semtō, comprising the nightclub’s \"main floor\", is a set of three sizable heated baths. The edges of each bathing pool are rimmed with nude and half-nude gangsters and club goers, their skin strobing under the undulating club light. Some put an AR modesty screen, but most don’t bother.\\n\\nThis music is deafening here and you can\\'t let it out you out and your teeth howl. Your cyber-netics rattle in place, shaking against the bones they’re pinned and grafted onto. On the edge of the largest pool you see some Yuna girls, basking in the attention of the party goers that dance in the waters and chat with drinks in their hands - they rule this place, and behave like its queens and princesses. Along one entire wall is a fully stocked bar tended by three bartenders, one android maid, and a small fleet of server drones.\\n\\nCharacters scoping out the room notice a dark doorway, deliberately obscured by the lights and decorations. It is an antique wooden sliding door adorned with a painting of a water dragon, which leads to The Hidden Shrine. The door opens magically if whispered the correct password (“poison”), a code most Yuna girls know, but are unable to directly say. Getting the password from one of them takes some clever thinking, as the Yuna are magically compelled to avoid talking about the shrine, and the area is supposed to be out of bounds for any non-Yuna person. Otherwise, the door could be opened by breaking the magic spell that protects it (magically-locked-3).\\n\\nThe negotiations are held here, the following tags apply: water everywhere, pounding bass beat', content_length=4733, page=290), Page(content=\"## THE HIDDEN SHRINE\\n\\nBehind the ornate door is another bath, this one much smaller and dominated by a tall stone statue of a water dragon spiraling over it. The room is dimly lit and the pounding beats of the club are surprisingly muted here. With so much noise being absent, this space feels somehow more real than everything else in the sentō, maybe even in the streets outside. Something authentic and special dwells here, though it does not seem benevolent. A chill goes up your spine. You are being studied by something.\\n\\nIf the PCs attempt to communicate with the spirit here in any way, the mizuchi makes itself visible as a writhing blue serpent floating above the pool. The room glows from its presence.\\n\\nThe mizuchi speaks in whispers. It knows about the deal that the Yuna girls are planning to make with the Ghost Market, and it doesn't like it. It provides no explanation as to why, and doesn’t reveal the deal it made with Kobayashi Tomoko, only stressing its desire to maintain the status quo. The spirit is open about its intentions to disrupt the negotiations, if asked. If the PCs want to stop it from harming the meeting, they’ll need to either bind it (maxing its bind Limit) or make a deal with the spirit (maxing its placate Limit). It is practically impossible for the crew to banish this kami, as the owners of this establishment acknowledge and accept its presence.\\n\\nIf the negotiations are held, the following tags apply:\\n- small space\\n- reverent silence\\n\\n### MIZUCHI\\n\\nThe looming spirit of a water serpent kami, inhabiting the small shrine to its power within the sentō. The mizuchi cannot speak above a whisper, but it can do so from anywhere in the building, whispering to any visitor. It only wishes to slowly drain some life force out of party goers (it can take some from anyone who enters one of the baths), and it knows that its ability to do so could be jeopardized if the Yuna join up with the Ghost Market and abandon the nightclub as their base of operations.\\n\\nThe mizuchi is bound by **serpent-promise**: keeping it from killing club patrons or speaking above a whisper. The Yuna are similarly bound, which prevents them from making any attempt to speak about the serpent or directly against it.\\n\\nThe mizuchi's **placate limit** represents its willingness to allow the negotiations to take place. Unless this is maxed out, the serpent will disrupt the negotiations during the **Negotiations**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## THE BACK ROOMS\\n\\nThe club's back rooms are used by the Yuna gang for storage, rest, offices and meetings. All of the rooms are either too small, too out of the way, or too messy and ugly to be of use as respectable meeting places. The gang invested all of the money in the club's front, and they themselves prefer to spend their time in the front rooms as well.\\n\\nKobayashi Tomoko's office serves as a meeting room for the gang's lieutenants. There's ugly junk as well as crates of small arms around. Yuna keep coming and going in search of some liquor or tool that Tomoko keeps in her office, annoyed that the crew are in their space.\\n\\n---\\n\\nProperty of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284\", content_length=3149, page=291), Page(content=\"# THE NIGHT'S ITINERARY\\n\\nThe events of the job proceed through the following scenes. Consequences can be used to push the timeline forward, or to represent demands that the Yuna gang make to the crew, such as asking them to meet with special guests outside and escort them to the VIP pool, or run minor errands around the sentō or the neighborhood.\\n\\nThe Yuna girls are not abusive, but they do intend to get everything they can out of the crew while they have them on hire.\\n\\nWhen the crew arrive at the nightclub, give them some time to explore. Kobayashi Tomoko is nowhere to be found (she arrives during Closing the Deal, page 295), so if they are waiting for her arrival to get some permissions, they’re wasting their time.\\n\\n## SEIRYU ARRIVES\\n\\nMore than half an hour before the time of the meeting, an argument erupts between Hase Rie, the bouncer at the front of the sentō, and an annoyed woman who seems to be threatening her. If the crew is not around to hear it, a Yuna girl chases them down, asking for their help – because the woman claims to be Seiryu, and Tomoko is not here to greet her. Seiryu's appearance, mannerisms, and Challenge profile are described on page 164.\\n\\nRie isn’t willing to allow Seiryu to enter until Tomoko gives her approval, and Seiryu is losing her patience. If the crew does not intervene, take their time, or take an action that leads to consequences, Seiryu blows powder at Rie’s face, which cuts off the larger woman’s ability to breathe. Seiryu then steps over the choking bouncer and enters the club. The people who were waiting in the line flee the area and the PCs gain botched-diplomacy-2, or botched-diplomacy-3 if they face Seiryu or try to stop her. Unless Rie is cared for by the crew, she dies in less than a minute.\\n\\nIf the crew intervene in time to make sure Seiryu gets into the club without a problem, she simply nods to them curtly as she goes inside.\\n\\nFrom now on, Seiryu sits on the bar in The Baths (she didn't undress, but she looks at others with amusement), taking little sips while she examines various data feeds and looks. \\n\\n---\\n\\nProperty of City of Mist. Issued to Tierra Duffield. Order #218284\", content_length=2159, page=292), Page(content='# THE ENFORCERS ARRIVE\\n\\nWhen the time of the meeting draws near, three Ghost Market representatives, known as Enforcers (page 164, with the chūnin Special) present themselves at the entrance to the sentō. They wear recognizable illegal AR headsets and bear criminal tattoos that prove their loyalty to the secret masters who control the Ghost Market.\\n\\nThe Enforcers demand to be met with Yuna representatives at the entrance, and be shown in. If Hase Rie is not there, Choko greets them, unless the crew is ready for their arrival and waiting for them. The Enforcers present themselves as the Ghost Market representatives, and if told that Seiryū is already here, they react with suspicion – since she was not supposed to be part of this negotiation. \"What kind of game are you playing?\" One of them will ask the crew, as all three tense up and become tense-2.\\n\\nThis is one of Seiryū\\'s famous power plays, an attempt to unbalance the Yuna and leave them confused. Seiryū is indeed in charge of the negotiations, she just didn\\'t tell the chūnin she\\'ll be coming. If the crew asks her about the Enforcers at the entrance, she laughs it off and tells the PCs the Enforcers “have her blessing\" to enter. However, the chūnin do not believe the crew, and they\\'ll only be content if they see Seiryū herself, which requires the crew to ask her nicely – which is exactly what she was going for. The crew might also manage to place the Enforcers somewhere else.\\n\\n# THE NEGOTIATIONS\\n\\nOnce they\\'ve entered the designated area for the meeting, the Enforcers work together to produce and set up a communication device with which they establish a cyberspace connection to another person. Seiryū stands before the device as a holographic figure appears, their head bowed, their eyes lowered. The genderless stranger is dressed in a white suit, and holds an ornate katana in its scabbard. Their face is obscured by fabric.\\n\\n“You stand before the projection of White Bird,\" Says Seiryū, her tone strict. “They are the master of the council of elders. You will show respect.\" The Enforcers and the Yuna gang members present bow before the holographic figure.\\n\\nUpon the appearance of White Bird, if even a single PC does not bow respectfully, they get botched-diplomacy-3. During the meeting, the Enforcers deploy a Mythic Near-space-blackout-5 which hinders all attempts to record the meeting or communicate with cyberspace outside of the meeting space. Only non-digital recording devices work here, and they cannot perceive White Bird\\'s AR projection.\\n\\nWhite Bird has no patience to wait for the arrival of Kobayashi Tomoko. If the crew do not present themselves as speakers for the Yuna gang, Choko takes a stand and improvises, announcing she was asked to substitute for the leader.\\n\\nThe negotiations now begin, progressing in the following three step order: Pleasantries, Hard Bargains, and Closing the Deal.\\n\\n# PLEASANTRIES\\n\\nIntroductions are made and both sides show respectful deference towards the other. Kobayashi Tomoko not being in attendance is a serious offense to White Bird, and they say so as a Threat. Unless the crew can come up with an appropriate explanation to save face, they take botched-diplomacy-3.\\n\\nIf they instead let Choko speak, she says Kobayashi is recovering from an attack on the Garbage Sisters, a rival gang with honorable ties who were trying to sabotage this meeting in order to destroy the Yuna’s reputation (the Sisters indeed exist, but have been in a ceasefire with the Yuna for several months). It’s a simple lie, and while White Bird sees right through it, they are willing to accept it. The whole point of the exercise is for the Yuna to show that they respect the Ghost Market and their time, Kobayashi herself doesn\\'t matter. The crew can only take botched-diplomacy-2; this is one of those rare occasions in which it might be best to just shut up and let the NPC do the talking. Choko only knows how to sound polite, though, and has no handle on negotiations.\\n\\nIf the crew now has botched-diplomacy-4 or higher, the Ghost Market Enforcers will insist that one of them – the one they perceive as the worst offender – be removed from the negotiations. The PCs can try to counter this demand, but the botched-diplomacy status hinders this action.\\n\\n# HARD BARGAINS\\n\\nOnce the pleasantries are out of the way, the real bargaining begins.\\n\\n**The Yuna’s Position:** Choko can explain what her gang has been up to in terms of smuggling, fencing, and supplying. She says that they have no intention of expanding, so the Ghost Market has nothing to worry about in terms of large-scale encroachment.', content_length=4615, page=293), Page(content=\"# The Ghost Market's Position\\nWhite Bird suggests that Choko and the Yuna are not being forthcoming about their activities and their plans. The Market only engages with those it can control; it has no equals, only subordinates. White Bird presents a simple ultimatum: the Yuna must become members of the Ghost Market’s cartel, selling their best goods only through its traveling black market and paying a large cut of their profits to the organization. If asked what will happen if the Yuna refuse, White Bird says: “You die.”\\n\\n## The Dispute\\nIn essence, the Yuna want to remain free to deal with other clients and cooperate with the Ghost Market while the Ghost Market wants them to become completely subordinate. There’s no question about the Yuna becoming a vassal; it’s only a matter of how much freedom they’ll be allowed to retain. White Bird makes it clear they have one third choice; since they will no longer allow the Yuna to continue to operate and possibly encroach on Market territory.\\n\\n## The Conversation\\nIt is up to the crew to secure the best possible outcome for their employers, the Yuna. This can be played out in the following ways:\\n\\n- Entirely via narration\\n- By using quick outcomes to establish milestones and understandings between the parties until an agreement is reached or the negotiations break down\\n- As a tracked conflict, using The Negotiations Challenge profile, where the PCs must max out remain-free:4 before White Bird runs out-of-patience:3, the Enforcers start-fighting:4, or botched-diplomacy:6 maxes out.\\n\\nThe botched-diplomacy status affects all attempts to negotiate in the Yuna’s name. Consider the Threats and Consequences listed in The Negotiations Challenge profile, even if you’re not using its Limits.\\n\\nThe crew is welcome to suggest other avenues. For example, the Ghost Market can find good use for a captured mizu-kami... White Bird would consider such a gift as worth allowing the Yuna to maintain autonomy for another year. The terms will then need to be reconsidered, but should the Yuna prove themselves honorable and profitable during this time, the negotiations will have a very different tone. Or, the Yuna could then procure another useful kami to trade for their freedom.\\n\\n## Choko\\nThroughout the negotiations, Choko can serve as the crew’s source of information. If no crew members take the negotiator role, Choko will continue to improvise, but her lack of professionalism is likely to derail the talks (see her Threat and Consequence).\\n\\n# The Mizuchi\\nAt a point of your choosing, the mizuchi begins to interfere, if it hasn’t been dealt with at its shrine. It begins to whisper into the ears of the Ghost Market representatives that are physically present that the Yuna are plotting against them, working with yōkai and other beasts that only wish to create chaos among the criminal elite. If the crew fails to calm things down and the mizuchi succeeds in sufficiently angering the Ghost Market representatives, they may start-fighting:4 and attack the Yuna and the crew.\\n\\n## The Negotiations\\n- **Limits**\\n  - REMAIN FREE:4\\n  - OUT OF PATIENCE:3\\n  - BOTCHED DIPLOMACY:6\\n  - START FIGHTING:4\\n\\n### Nearspace-blackout-5:\\n- **Threats / Consequences**\\n  - Enforcers cross arms in frustration\\n  - Emotions flare (all Enforcers and Yuna present get angry):2\\n  - Enforcers look to White Bird for guidance\\n    - White Bird makes an understated threat (botched-diplomacy:2)\\n  - Seiryū begins addressing one of the PCs\\n    - Seiryū deliberately offends or angers that PC (provoked:4)\\n  - White Bird is unnervingly silent\\n    - Everyone senses White Bird’s patience is wearing thin (losing-patience:-1)\\n  - (If the crew lets Choko lead) Choko is too casual in her conversation and too often gets distracted by her AR feeds\\n    - White Bird calls out her disrespectful attitude (botched-diplomacy:3)\\n  - The Enforcers and Seiryū stand still for a moment (as they listen to the whispers of the mizuchi)\\n    - The Enforcers and Seiryū become angry:2\", content_length=3998, page=294), Page(content=\"# FIGHTING IT OUT...\\n\\nIf a fight ensues, the chūnin focus on trying to kill present Yuna, while Seiryū departs. The Enforcers issue warnings to any crew member who interferes that they won't be harmed if they stand to the side. If attacked or prevented from harming the Yuna, they engage with the crew until death. White Bird watches in silence until they decide to deactivate the link, and the device burns itself.\\n\\n...OR CLOSING THE DEAL\\n\\nAssuming negotiations continue, ultimately it's up to the Yuna to decide their own fate. If they manage to remain free, Choko signs up enthusiastically. Otherwise, she asks the crew what they think the Yuna should do, now that they've had a chance to see the Ghost Market up close and personal. The Yuna all agree that they're not afraid of the Ghost Market, and are able to defend their home turf, and they consider their autonomy too important to just sell out.\\n\\nUnless persuaded otherwise, the Yuna will refuse White Bird's offer. If they are convinced to work for the Ghost Market's cartel, they're not happy about it, but they end the negotiations with their underworld reputation intact. If they decide to decline the offer, the Enforcers swear vengeance and get ready to withdraw.\\n\\nBefore the deal is struck, Kobayashi Tomoko finally arrives. Sweating and somewhat drug-addled, she apologizes profusely to White Bird, and takes all blame on herself, a move that the old master appreciates. If the Yuna have already signed to become a semi-independent part of the cartel, White Bird is forgiving. Tired of talking, they then just disconnect.\\n\\nIn all other cases, White Bird instead issues a final demand: they are willing to let the Yuna join their cartel and maintain autonomy (and forgive all botched-diplomacy) at the cost of Choko's head. Tomoko must prove that she is not only capable of shouldering responsibility, but also act, and handle her own people. Tomoko asks for the crew's help in avoiding this resolution, but should they fail, she ultimately agrees to the terms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# AFTERMATH\\n\\nIn the best case scenario, the Yuna remain independent and now also work with the Ghost Market. Tomoko knows the importance of networking and doesn’t quickly forget who did good by her.\\n\\nShe maintains contact with the crew and offers them Yuna goods at reasonable prices (they are able to easily source most Enhancers on the Tokyo Street Catalog, page 86).\\n\\nIf the Yuna declined the Market's offer, they now have the enmity of an organization secretly run by the shimbō. Many in the underworld cut connections with them, and it’s up to the PCs if they want to still be associated with the Yuna. Kobayashi Tomoko has further need for them, and would like to hire the crew to protect various Yuna initiatives — some groups are already seeing them as weak and try to prey on them.\\n\\nIf the crew defeated the Enforcers through violence, they may have ruined their reputation among the criminals of the black market and potential employers. However, there is a surprising number of patrons, among them several powerful corp executives, who are looking for someone brave and foolish enough to do what the crew did. They are willing to pay in rare assets and privileged access to those who are ready to keep being incredibly brave.

As a result, exposed subjects show superhuman awareness and wisdom, but also a deep desire to promote the enlightenment of all mankind (akin to a bodhisattva or a saint).\\n\\nHikage based the substance on fungi harvested from the Amanohashidate Sandbar near Kyoto, which according to myth is part of the fallen bridge. By doing so, they drew the attention of the entities who have been keeping an eye on this place for ages.\\n\\nThe secretive employers of the crew are Hiruma-Miyaki Corporate Group (HMCG), actually a corporate front for the Amatsukami spirits, protectors of Japan who reside in Takamagahara, the heaven beyond the bridge (a kami island, page 33). These powerful beings remember a time when Heaven and Earth were joined, when they were able to shape humanity’s destiny according to their view of what is best for mankind. While their intentions are pure, the Amatsukami’s ways are definitely alien, and some may see their master plan as a wish to force a transhumanist transformation on mankind to make them more like the kami. Initially, they plan to spread the Junō Source-touched substance from a high point over a populated district, rebuilding the residents' psyches to transcend the Noise and then their Self – freeing (or disconnecting) them from the human experience completely.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# JOB BRIEFING\\n\\nListen up, there’s a briefcase that needs a chaperone.\\n\\nRecently, one of the Iribe-gumi Yakuza Syndicate (page 222) managed to get his hands on a prototype formula called Junō (“pure heart”, “naivety”) produced by Hikage Pharmaceuticals. Your client is interested in buying this stolen property.\\n\\nYour contact with the client is the Yatagarasu, an enigmatic figure who only approaches people in cyberspace. True to her namesake, a divine crow who guides mortals, the Yatagarasu appears as a pale Japanese woman in an ornate kimono with sleek, black feathers in place of hair and piercing golden eyes. She already handled the negotiations with the Iribe-gumi, you only have to pick up the package from the courier.\\n\\nThis Yakuza courier is nicknamed Habu (a deadly South-Asian snake), and he’ll be waiting for you at a food vendor’s stall in the famed Ghost Market (page 159). Habu is an infamous troublemaker, so the Yatagarasu wants to make sure everything’s set before giving you more information about the next step. Once the case is in your hands, you’ll contact her to confirm receipt and be told the dropoff point. You will then bring it securely to a meeting spot, and job’s done.\\n\\nOh, and the briefcase? More like an environmentally-sealed code-locked case. Better be careful with that thing.\\n\\nTo get the Junō substance, the Yatagarasu, agent of the Amatsukami, contracted Habu, an established thief of the Iribe-gumi Yakuza Syndicate, to break into Hikage Pharmaceuticals. Because of its extreme potency, and because she didn’t trust Habu, the Yatagarasu provided him with a special case, environmentally-sealed and magically protected. The Yakuza were paid well not to ask questions, only to deliver the case to the Ghost Market.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# JOB SYNOPSIS\\n\\nThe crew's job is to pick up the case from Habu at the Ghost Market, and confirm it’s in their possession by activating a code on the case’s display.\\n\\nThe first part is going to be tricky, since Habu is dead. As the crew is about to discover, the rival Maikubi-kai Yakuza clan (page 222) killed Habu and took the case. The crew will have to get it back by infiltrating a Maikubi-kai dog fighting parlor, which hides a Yakuza drug diolab. By the\", content_length=4163, page=297), Page(content=\"time the crew arrives the technicians become exposed to the substance and become enlightened, providing the first hint that something serious is going on.\\n\\nWith the case in their hands, the crew is able to contact the Yatagarsaru who reveals where it is to be taken: a Zen garden skybridge at the Tokyo Cascade, a famously tall building in one of Tokyo's more populated areas. The Bureau of Onmyō keeps a secret House of Zen (page 314) on the skybridge, and the Yatagarsau knows one of the statues there holds the imprisoned Source of Amenonuhoko (the jeweled spear used to raise Japan from the ocean), which will help to disperse the enthogeon over the entire district.\\n\\nThe Yatagarsau keeps all of this from the crew, but they can dig a bit and discover further details on the substance and their employers. They are eventually contacted by the Bureau of Onmyō, who wants to get rid of the substance before it does any more harm to the Megacity. They too want the case taken to the Tokyo Cascade, because that Jeweled Spear can be used to seal the Junō substance and remove it as a threat.\\n\\nWhoever the crew decides to work with, they'll be chased by the other side as they make their way to the Tokyo Cascade, where a final confrontation awaits. Or they can choose to work with neither side, and paint a giant target on their backs.\\n\\nGOOD VS. HUMAN\\nThe moral dilemma in this job revolves around the question of whether the crew would sacrifice their own humanity to achieve a better world, and whether they should make this choice for others. For this to be effective, the Amatsukami should be presented as truly benevolent. There is no dilemma in whether evil alien spirits trying to transform humanity should be stopped. But when kind-hearted angels are trying to make things better for everyone at the cost of leaving humanity behind, each PC is meaningfully confronted with all the things that make them human and that they're unwilling to let go of, for better or for worse. This makes for better roleplaying and cinematic moments.\\n\\nHOOKS\\nFor most hooks, this will seem like a regular job until the crew is in too deep and realizes the massive stakes involved. The Yatagarsau would like to meet with the crew via VR once they accept the mission, to see them for herself and to answer a few basic questions, although vaguely, and never revealing what's in the case or who she is working for. Before flying away she presents the crew with a code to be input into the case once it's in their hands, which is the only way to contact her again.\\n\\n- An easy way for a group of All-Around Enforcers, Found Family, Rebellious Street Gang, or a Wanted crew to get involved in this scenario is for a shugo (Honor Among Mercs, page 16) to contract them out to the blue, connecting them with an employer who wishes to remain anonymous. This kind of thing happens all the time for street mercenaries, although the shugo would be a respected one, hinting that the employer, and the job, are more important than they seem.\\n\\n- For a Source Cabal or Source-Hunting Privateers, the Yatagarsau specifically seeks them out for being well-versed in Sources. She sees these characters as ready allies in the Amatsukami against the Noise, and assumes they will support the kami’s aims when these are revealed.\\n\\n- A crew of Elite Specialists working for a corporation could be referred to the Yatagarsau as part of business dealings. The crew’s regular employers are working on a deal with the Hiruma-Miyaki Corporate Group and offer the services of their troubleshooters as part of the incentives.\\n\\n- If the crew are Community Protectors, place the Tokyo Cascade in their district or nearby. The Yatagarsau might be more open regarding her intentions, trying to appeal to the crew’s sense of community.\", content_length=3786, page=298), Page(content='# ACT I: GHOSTED\\n\\nTo make their meeting, the crew will first need to track down the current location of the Ghost Market (page 159), the ever-changing and ever-moving underground night market of the Megacity.\\n\\nThis can be achieved with divination, by hacking an invite (such as a nefarious arms dealer), or by leveraging contacts in the Megacity’s criminal underworld. This could be resolved as a quick outcome with a tier-3 opposing status such as **secretive-3** or **firewall-3**, with potentially substantial consequences, such as being **indebted-3** to their contact.\\n\\nUnless they have had dealings with the Ghost Market before, the crew are unlikely to get more than a one-time invitation, but that’s enough.\\n\\n## ENTERING THE GHOST MARKET\\n\\nThe night is hot, noisy, and smells of burnt plastic. So everything’s as usual. The only hint that something’s off, that you’re on the right direction toward the Ghost Market, is the occasional cherry petal dancing in the unseen winds, an AR artifact you can only see thanks to the cryptocoins you were given. As you turn a corner, you are almost blinded for a moment by a storm of petals, revealing behind it - the Ghost Market.\\n\\nThe Ghost Market, while within the Megacity, is not of the Megacity. It is a realm of hope bridges hung between the abandoned metal towers of an old server farm. Stand\\xading solemnly within a cavernous warehouse, the tall metal structures that once held the servers of a digital world have been hung with glowing lanterns and swaying pathways, supported by data and power cables. Suspended platforms hold market stalls of all sorts as visitors mingle at a dozen different heights. In AR, neon red cherry trees rise between the ropes, shedding petals that disappear into a heavily-encrypted AR layer that bathes everything in a fog.\\n\\nThe large towers have been stripped of most of their valuable parts long ago and now score new life filled with hidden spaces which some shopkeepers are exploiting. The **swaying bridges** might prove unsteady footing in a fight, which is exactly why they’re here, a deterrent against violence. Several high-voltage cables provide electricity for the hanging lanterns, which are the only source of light around, casting huge shadows across the towers. In cyberspace, Nearscape is full of thick fog hiding several Harnessed Enforcers (page 164).\\n\\nOnce the crew has a chance to look around, continue.\\n\\nA few moments after you enter the Market grounds, an AR figure flickers to life before you, like a visiting ghost. It is a thin man with almost reptilian features, his brimmed hat pulled low and a dramatic cape draped over his shoulders. His voice is clear even with the noise of the Market.\\n\\n“Greetings, I am Habu. This recording is encrypted and keyed to you so I can speak freely.” Habu gives a dramatic sweep of his cape and a devilish grin twinkles under the hat’s brim.\\n\\n“I have the package, but I have picked up several tails. I can lose them, but I encourage you to arrive at the pick-up prepared. I was told you are professionals.” It’s unclear if he is emphasizing efficiency, or to mislead.\\n\\nHis image lifts a bulky environmentally-sealed case. “It seems heavy. I have encoded the location of the pick-up in this message. Come when you are ready.” With a final flourish of his cape, Habu’s recording ends.\\n\\nHabu’s pick-up point is at the **Kushikatsu Odoroki Stall**, but the crew might want to take his warning to heart; the Ghost Market provides ample opportunity to stock up on equipment.\\n\\n## SHOPPING SPREE\\n\\nThe stalls within the Market project an AR overlay that can only be seen by authorized visitors, offering a range of military-grade drugs, stolen data, unsanctioned cybertech, destructive computer viruses, assassins for hire, and the latest cyber implant inside info. For more in\\xadformation on making purchases at the market, see **Plans and Loadouts At The Ghost Market** (page 161).\\n\\nIf the crew wishes to haggle with the merchants, use the **Ghost Market Dealer Challenge** (page 163). If the crew threatens the dealers or causes trouble, the situation could change into a standoff with **Enforcers** (page 164), who will give a single warning before banishing the crew from the premises, both digitally and physically.', content_length=4253, page=299), Page(content='# THE MARKET IN CYBERSPACE\\n\\nIn AR and VR, tonight\\'s Ghost Market appears to be a forest of massive, crystalline trees shrouded in smoke. As visitors move through the space, the smoke solidifies into pathways beneath them like the swinging bridges of the physical market.\\n\\nThere are signs of trouble here, indicators of lurking threats that also concerned Habu. The jōnin who control the Market know that the Maikubi-kai Syndicate has been sniffing around, and while they don’t want to discourage commerce in the physical market, they have placed Harnessed Enforcers as observers, crawling through the crystal branches of the digital trees in monkey-like avatars. The jōnin mistakenly expect the Maikubi-kai to launch a brute-force attack through cyberspace, as they’ve done in the past.\\n\\n## RUMORS FROM THE MOUTH OF A FOX\\n\\nBefore or after meeting with Habu, the crew might want to learn about the threats surrounding them. They’re in the right place, as information brokers from all across Japan harness into the Ghost Market server to sell and trade.\\n\\nAs exceptional individuals, though, the crew will attract the attention of a particular broker named Chiyo (\"a thousand years\") who is distinctly looking around. Chiyo approaches them boldly, using the fox-based avatar of a kitsune (fox spirit), and implies that she already knows what they want to find out.\\n\\nIn reality, Chiyo is an actual kitsune (page 119) who has successfully deployed her power into a digital avatar to give her some magical abilities in cyberspace. She likes theatrical displays, so her kitsune avatar constantly performs close up street magic, and while talking to the crew she might make a coin disappear and reappear, pretend to bend a metal spoon with her mind, or pull a paper with information from behind their ear. Since this is cyberspace, the tricks are far from impressive, but Chiyo meets skepticism with a yipping fox-laugh.\\n\\nWhile Chiyo knows less than she’s implying, the kitsune is able to use her sorcery to read the tides of fortune and knows that the crew is currently, or soon will be, at odds with the Maikubi-kai Yakuza clan. She will drop hints about what she knows to draw the crew in, but to get actual answers the player characters will need to exchange a little life energy. Under the guise of picking a card for a card trick, Chiyo gives seekers drained-1 for each answer she provides, slowly drawing on their strength (this can be mitigated as normal). Understanding the cause for the sudden feeling of weakness requires a roll affected by Chiyo’s mysterious-2.\\n\\n## KUSHIKATSU ODOROKI STALL\\n\\nKushikatsu, meat fried on wooden skewers, originated in the Osaka area, but has spread throughout Japan as a street food with a thousand variations. Kushikatsu Odoroki serves them all with a wide selection that also serves above a countertop. The whole stall – counter, kitchen, and all – is crammed on a small platform which hangs to the side of one of the footbridges, held by glowing neon ropes. Hanging swings serve as seats, some of which would leave customers dangling over a twenty-meter drop. Despite the bright lanterns and long menu, the platform is quiet and no one is here.\\n\\nThe meeting with Habu takes place at Kushikatsu Odoroki, a small food stall serving kushikatsu-style skewered, fried meat. The platform is hung over a very high drop.\\n\\nDigital indicators in AR show that the Kushikatsu Odoroki also offers off-the-record courier services like the sort Habu could use and any player characters with criminal ties might have even heard of it. But the data is heavily fragmented, and in cyberspace the place is surrounded by empty blackness, the result of an advanced digital bomb that was detonated by the Maikubi-kai.\\n\\nWhen the crew enters or surveys the stall in physical space, read the following.\\n\\nBehind the counter, two cooks are laying on the floor, both dead from expertly precise wounds. In the tiny kitchen behind them, your contact Habu too is laying life-', content_length=3980, page=300), Page(content='less, on top of his fancy cape. It’s clear that he gave more of a fight: Habu’s dramatic cape is stained with blood, and the knife in his kidney bears the clear image of three severed samurai heads, even advertising it into AR. There is no sign of the case.\\n\\nEveryone knows that killing within the Ghost Market is a very big no-no, with the offender likely to either be banned for life or found mysteriously dead.\\n\\n## INVESTIGATING THE SCENE\\n\\nMore details about the murder on the Ghost Market is can be learned by taking action to investigate the scene.\\n\\n- A PC may recall the image of three severed samurai heads is used by the Maikubi-kai Yakuza clan, who are currently at war with the Iribe-gumi clan, to which Habu belongs.\\n\\n- Habu put up a good fight, but was overwhelmed by at least three assailants. They seemed to have come specifically for the case, and had no issue with dealing death.\\n\\n- Checking the timestamps in AR or if the bodies are examined with forensic knowledge or psychic means, it’s possible to come to the conclusion that the assailants left no more than a few minutes ago. They left no trail that can be tracked.\\n\\n## TRACKING DOWN THE CASE\\n\\nFinding out where the Maikubi-kai assassins escaped with the case requires an additional action or spending additional Power on Discover, either within the Market (asking Ghost Market Dealers or Chiyo) or after leaving it. As the Maikubi-kai are a major player in the Megacity and are known for being loud, it’s not hard to find someone who knows about their local operations; a big score like this case will make some waves in the rumor sphere within even an hour or two.\\n\\nHabu’s killers, the assassins themselves, are lost to the winds and won’t be found during this job. However, all signs point at them dropping the case at the Hungry Dog Pachinko Parlor, which is a known dog fighting ring. A great success or more Power spent on Discover can reveal the place received an unusual shipment of pharmaceutical equipment lately, as if in preparation to do some lab work; this is because the Maikubi-kai are aware that the contents of the case were produced by Hikage Pharmaceuticals, and are getting ready to examine them.\\n\\n## NEZUMI AMBUSH\\n\\nBefore leaving, the Maikubi-kai assassins tipped off a gang of Nezumi Punks (page 110) that an easy target might be coming by soon. The assassins convinced the brash Nezumi that fighting “just outside” the Ghost Market is permitted, not that it helps the punks, since they weren’t invited and can’t see the Market’s limits.\\n\\nAs the crew prepares to leave, the punks approach (half a dozen, Scale 2). They surround the crew on one of the bridges and try to bully them, soon resorting to violence in an attempt to steal anything valuable. After one or two of them are down (once the collective takes any status on hurt-or-subdue), they probably realize they’re facing professional mercers, and start running away.\\n\\nDepending on how loud things get, this could become a very messy, very cinematic running fight between the crew, the Nezumi, and the Market’s Enforcers as the crew tries to escape-the-market along swinging bridges and down metal towers.\\n\\n## EXPLAINING AWAY THE BLAME\\n\\nShould the crew engage in conversation with the Enforcers, and especially if they come to the g:en of their own, it might be hard for them to really answer for what happened in Kushikatsu Odoroki. Cyberspace logs reveal the damage was done before any of the crew even approached the area, and as mentioned before, the masters of the Ghost Market already suspected a Maikubi-kai attack was coming tonight. It might take some time, during which they are detained by the genin, but the crew is eventually absolved of all wrongdoing. The same is true for a fight initiated by the Nezumi Punks, assuming of course the violence was indeed initiated by them, and not a trigger-happy PC.\\n\\nIf the PCs run away with no explanation, though, this resolution might come only much later on. The genin will eventually chase the crew to their homes and kidnap them, to be put on trial before a chūnin, but that is beyond the scope of this job.\\n', content_length=4118, page=301), Page(content=\"# ACT II: FED TO THE HOUNDS\\n\\nThe **Hungry Dog Pachinko Parlor** is a Maikubi-kai stronghold under the management of a 20-something fool called Ichiro.\\n\\nThis permanently-bruised bully is the son of an important shatei, placed here by the higher ups to keep him out of trouble. The parlor practically runs itself, as do the secret kennels and genetic lab in the basement, so the higher ups figured Ichiro couldn't mess things up.\\n\\n## HUNGRY DOG PACHINKO PARLOR\\n\\nThe clicking and clacking of metal balls. The bright flashing lights and chiming sounds of games and advertisements. The smells of street food and asphalt, still hot from the day. The rancid smell of gamblers, sweaty and often drunk. The Hungry Dog Pachinko Parlor looks a lot like most betting establishments, but with the added veneer of organized criminality waiting to unleash violence.\\n\\nThe betting parlor is built on top of a hidden **Inugami Kennels** and **Canine Biolab**, where the stolen case was brought.\\n\\nTo enter the place, the crew can simply blend in with the crowd. The Nezumi Punks Market are the only ones who saw the crew's faces, so as long as they avoid drawing attention, it's possible to get inside with ease.\\n\\nIf they **snoop around first**, though, the crew can notice several guards outside, hinting something more is happening here, and that the betting parlor is a front. A wide door at the back of the building, specifically, seems to have a lot of security around it. It opens into a cargo elevator leading down to the Inugami Kennels.\\n\\nTo gain entry, the crew can attempt to sneak past the guards and **hack-open** the door. If they’re spotted, the guards attempt to subdue them – see the sidebar **Captured!** The Security Guards ([Metro: Otherscape, page 305](#)) have the Street Fighting Power Set (page 135) and are armed with tasers that inflict **stunned-3**.\\n\\n## THE ARENA\\n\\nThe sound hits you like a sonic wall as you walk past the entrance, followed by the scent of burning drugs and the glitter of AR-enhanced outfits. The crowd, a mix of every social rung in the Megacity, all seem on edge, ready for violence. The cause of the bloodthirsty tone becomes clear as soon as the Pit comes into view.\\n\\nOn the sand-covered floor of an arena five meters down, two notorious fighters are locked in vicious combat. They superficially resemble dogs, but someone has modified their genome in unspeakable ways to create something more like demons.\\n\\nAs with many other Maikubi-kai gambling establishments in the Megacity, the inugami fighting arena is the main draw of this pachinko parlor. While patrons watch from above, the inugami fight in an arena that is directly adjacent to the Inugami Kennels on the basement level.\\n\\nDog fighting is illegal in Tokyo, so the Maikubi-kai circumvented the issue by creating the inugami (“dog god”), named after the mythical phenomena of becoming possessed by the spirit of a dog. These inugami are not Mythical, but nor are they technically dogs.\\n\\n## MIXING WITH THE CROWD\\n\\nThe dubious audience around the arena is focused on the kennel doors below before the match, and becomes completely wild during a fight. If the crew raise the suspicion of the Maikubi-kai here, the Yakuza will attempt to deal with them subtly by slipping them drugged drinks or pricking them in the crowd with a drugged needle (**drugged-unconscious-5**). If the crew openly cause a fuss, the Yakuza...\\n\", content_length=3406, page=302), Page(content='# INUGAMI KENNELS\\nLoud barking noises, resembling screeching or grinding more than dog howls, echo from some distant chamber of this dimly lit series of corridors you’ve found yourselves in. The floor is plastic and the walls are pale green, with pipes and wires strewn across the ceilings.\\n\\n“Is this them?”\\n\\nA young man, his thick black hair brushed to the side in the current fashion of rich idiots, approaches from a corridor, shutting down some AR communication with one hand while holding a half-eaten energy bar in the other. \\n\\n“Hey, yeah, so you’re here for the package?” He grins.\\n\\nThe kennels are a basement facility for housing the inugami and they encircle the arena, which is on the same level. They are connected to the Canine Biolab at different points by a number of exposed concrete corridors. When the crew eventually advances towards the lab, an alarm sounds (as a Threat). While it might seem related to their interloping (or to the inugami running wild in the corridors, see below), it was in fact triggered by a containment breach near the lab.\\n\\n## ICHIRO\\nIf the crew enters the kennels on their own terms, they are likely to bump into Ichiro; either he’s heard word of their approach or he is simply proving his domain (used the Gang Member Challenge in *Metro: Otherscape* page 306, with the Maikubi-kai Power Set page 227). The good-for-nothing Yakuza handler knows someone will probably be coming after the secret package he received earlier, and, fancying himself a cunning crook, he just can’t help trying to pit his “smarts” against his opponents’. He welcomes the crew in, explains he is in charge, tells them he knows they’re here for the case. From there on, Ichiro may do any of the following:\\n\\n- Feign disinterest, saying he’ll just give the case to the crew “since it’s of no use to us”.\\n  \\n- Try to lure the PCs into The Arena and lock the gates behind them. If he can’t manage it, he might even foolishly walk into the arena with them and lock himself in, believing he could take down the inugami.\\n\\n- Unleash inugami into the corridors of the basement to devour the crew, most likely losing control over the beasts.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIGHT! FIGHT! \\nThe floor is covered in what feels and smells clearly like old blood. Above and all around, wide transparent aluminum windows show gang members watching and laughing. You even see some screens flashing bets back and forth. All of this becomes markedly less important as large metal grates on the other side of the room begin to slowly lower, and a bone-chilling howl comes through.\\n\\nIf the PCs end up inside the arena at any point, the Maikubi-kai will unleash the inugami (page 226) on them. This should be a challenging fight, but not necessarily deadly; the Maikubi-kai want a long and bloody fight, not a massacre, so they release only a few inugami at a time. One or two inugami should be more than enough, especially if the crew is without their weapons and/or wounded.\\n\\nIn the middle of the fight, once the tide seems about to turn in the crew’s or the inugami’s favor, an alarm sounds.\\n\\nAs the creature crouches low for another attack, you see some commotion in the kennels beyond the metal grates that encircle the arena. There is inaudible shouting and the Yakuza look at each other with uncertainty. More shouting, and then the group quickly leaves. The alarm blares on.\\n\\nA contamination breach just happened in Canine Biolab and it means that the Maikubi-kai will not be around to release more inugami when the current threats are neutralized. The crew can open the door with no one to stop them (unlock:2 or batter-down:4, or if Ichiro is there, grab his personal hanko seal and use it to unlock the door).', content_length=3695, page=303), Page(content='## CANINE BIOLAB\\n\\nThese rooms clearly serve as a high-grade biotechnology lab, radiating order and professionalism that contrasts with the rough and lawless atmosphere of the rest of this building. Syringes and surgical equipment are arranged neatly next to gleaming tables and a refrigerator to the side filled with carefully-labeled sample vials. The walls are covered with holographic charts of the muscular systems of canine creatures.\\n\\nThe calm and silence of the lab is disrupted with a clatter from the back of the space. A woman walks out of a lab space further back, her spiked hair and neck tattoo marking her as one of the Yakuza, but her white coat and badge indicate she is a technician in this lab. Smeared across her face is some gold-colored liquid and there’s a faint glow to her eyes. The technician pays no attention to you, but runs her hand along a surgical table. “Chromium 12.1%,” she says absently to herself, “carbon 1.1%, trace nickel and molybdenum... Stainless steel, type 418.” She moves on to the next table and repeats the ritual, seemingly determining the chemical composition of everything in the lab at a glance.\\n\\nThe Canine Biolab is where the Maikubi-kai employ scientists to develop the inumagi. The entrance to the lab is hermetically sealed, requiring an action to open. If the crew has Ichiro’s private hanko, they can just press it to the panel and the door will open.\\n\\nUpon entering, the crew comes upon an enlightened-6 lab technician, who has come in contact with the Jun’jö substance after the lab team attempted to open the environmental case taken from Habu. The technicians used heavy equipment in their attempt to break through the lock, but all they managed to do is pry one of the clasps slightly open, just enough to allow some of the golden entheogen to leak out. This particular technician started to see the composition of everything around her, laid out like computer code. Other technicians, found in other rooms of the laboratory space, had different experiences:\\n', content_length=2022, page=304), Page(content='- A thick-set man sits in a lotus position in one surgical area, floating a few centimeters above the surgical table. His eyes are closed, his gold-smeared hands folded in his lap, and a blissful smile creases his face as he contemplates something and everything.\\n\\n- At a corner of an office, five Yakuza enforcers kneel at the feet of a small woman, offering prayers to her as \"a living kami\". Three other enforcers lay closer to her, two with compound fractures, one dead. The woman, who has a golden liquid smeared on her hands, pays them no heed, scribbling furiously on a clipboard. She is writing dense, incomprehensible philosophical theory over the top of lab reports.\\n\\n- A man with a thick scar on his arm, clearly not a technician but smeared with the gold liquid, wanders past the crew saying he needs to \"teach to the masses\", although whenever he\\'s asked about the subject of his teachings, he gives a different answer. He\\'s firm in his desire to leave, but otherwise not aggressive (allowing him to go back to the pachinko parlor could result in security showing up).\\n\\n- A nonbinary technician is working at a lab bench with two different vials of materials around them, all grabbed from a nearby lab fridge.

If asked what they are doing, the technician only replies \"Curing loneliness. I am very busy, please.\"\\n\\nTalking to those affected by the Junŏ will offer only strange and cryptic answers, but several things are evident: the conditions of these people are extremely varied, and they are all focused and in fine physical health. Investigating the scene can connect the golden liquid with the strange situation, and confirm it is of Mythic origins.\\n\\nTHE STOLEN CASE\\nOn the far lab bench there is an environmental case of the sort described by the Yatagarasagoto: octagonal, with several clasps and a digital touchscreen. Next to it is an industrial circular saw, a liquid nitrogen tank, and a beaker of strong acid which were clearly used in attempts to open this thing. All they\\'ve managed to do, however, is \"mildly damage one of the seals\". Through a tiny opening, a small bit of a fluorescent golden liquid leaked out, some is still smeared on the case\\'s surface. The golden fingerprints and handprints around suggest the rush the technicians must have been in when they accidentally contaminated themselves.\\n\\nThis is the environmental case carrying the entheogen. The leak self-sealed shortly after being created, so if the crew is careful, they can move the case with no further issues. The first character to touch the Junŏ leftovers gains the status enlightened-6. This is an overwhelming and powerful, but not necessarily negative condition created by the entheogen\\'s unique composition. Describe to the players the feeling of sagacity, of opening to a new plane of reality and taking the first step toward true understanding, which can be both frightening and tempting, a chance to transcend beyond the bounds of human existence and all that entails.\\n\\nThe infection can be mitigated with appropriate Mythic powers, such as being awarded, as well as tags representing mental and emotional fortitude or resilience. Alternatively, PCs can simply roll with their Self as their Power (see Rolling With Self, Mythos, Or Noise, Metro:Otherrs-cape, page 122).\\n\\nThe final status tier is at tier 5, the PC passes out from the overwhelming experience, and wakes up later with enlightened-4. If the final status is at tier 6, the player chooses a theme to lose (most appropriately a Self of Noise theme) and replaces it with a Mythos theme representing enlightenment such as Zenlike Peace (page 65) or the Celestial Grace theme kit on the next page; then remove the status.\\n\\nThe enlightened status helps with all actions to understand the kami and converse with them, and represents extreme clarity of thought and feeling that could be helpful to many actions, directly or indirectly, at your option.

They might decide to go hacking, hit the streets, or otherwise dig for details about their employers, the case they procured, or its origin.\\n\\nThe Bureau of Onmyō eventually shows up, headed by Chief Inspector Ishikawa Rin herself, to warn the crew about the dangerous substance in their possession. The Yatagarsu will also show some of her cards, in an attempt to get the crew on her side. The events of this act can occur at any order.\\n\\n### CONTACTING THE YATAGARASU\\nOnce online, the code you obtained from the case transforms into a three-legged crow and flies away into cyberspace. Soon, from that direction, another figure sweeps in on black wings. The avatar of the Yatagarsu appears as you saw her before, a Japanese woman in an ornate kimono with long black feathers in place of hair. This time she also has wide, black-feathered wings sweeping from her back that fold away and disappear as she lands.\\n\\nThe crew was instructed to confirm possession of the case by entering the Yatagarsu code into it. The output is yet another sting of code which, once uploaded into cyberspace, summons the Yatagarsu herself. The Yatagarsu appears as an avatar in VR, AR, or even in meatspace, a holographic projection of unknown source.\\n\\nNow that the case is secured, the Yatagarsu continues to the next phase of the plan: securing the crew\\'s support in transforming the Megacity forever. In this meeting, her goal is to convince the crew to aid her and to accurately determine if they are earnestly willing to do so. She will share what she knows as it serves these purposes.\\n\\n### THE INFORMATION\\n- The case holds a compound known as Junjō, an entheogen (\"soul-liberating gift,\" as she calls it) in concentrated form. The substance channels the power of the Ame-no-ukihashi, bridging the gap between humanity and the gods. It is a gift from the Amatsu-kami, allowing mere mortals to transcend their human.\\n', content_length=2729, page=306), Page(content=\"# THE OUTCOME\\n- If the crew genuinely side with her, she reveals the location to which Jun'jō must be taken to.\\n- If the PCs are unwilling to help or if she does not yet trust their intentions, the Yatagarasu suggests they take until the following sunset one day to come to terms with the realization that they could transcend and leave behind the world of petty material things.\\n- If the crew tells her truthfully that they do not wish to help her any further, she respects their choice but insists that they return the case to her. She will send a different courier to take it from them at the following sunset. She is hoping some time to process might help the crew come around.\\n- If they lie, for whatever reason, she calls them out on it and likewise insists on the return of the case.\\n\\n# DOING THE LEGWORK\\n## RESEARCHING THE YATAGARASU\\nIf the crew looks into the Yatagarsu (note her mysterious -3), they can uncover the following:\\n- The Yatagarsu not only appears as a divine messenger, but truly seems to have some divine powers. She can see through any lie and hide from any spy. She also seems incredibly incorruptible, a true believer in her employers.\\n- She works for the Hiruma-Miyaki Corporate Group (HMCG), a big behind-the-scenes investor in cognitive science, cognitive psychology, parapsychology, religion studies, and sociology, developing techniques for inducing memory, emotions, and out-of-body experiences.\\n- HMCG's corporate headquarters are in the same district as Hikage, on the other side of the Megacity. Why then was the case not taken directly from one to the other, and instead brought here? (This hints at the Yatagarsu’s plan to disperse the substance, if the PCs don’t know it yet.)\\n\\n## STUDYING JUN'JŌ\\nThe crew may be curious about the case and its mysterious contents. Using scientific methods to study it will require access to a biochemistry lab (such as the one in the [Canine Biolab](#)), but the crew can also learn much through their arcane abilities or resources.\\n- The case was custom-made by specialists: it’s made of a super-resilient alloy with in-built sensors which monitor both the contents and its surroundings.

If they can convince Takibi they have the sought-after case, or knowledge of Habu’s death, a virtual meeting can be arranged.\\n\\nThe prearranged cyberspace meeting space is a virtual sake bar populated by automated patrons sharing bottles and playing quiet games of chance. When your contact appears there is no mistaking him: a shirtless man with Yakuza tattoos covering nearly his entire torso and onto his neck and arms. He moves with deadly grace, and everything about him screams “annihilation”, emphasized by the flames where his avatar’s eyes should be. He takes a seat at a small table, after which his followers allow you to approach and sit as well. His arms folded, his back straight, he looks at you, unblinking.\\n\\nThe meeting can be played out as a tracked outcome to convince Takibi that the crew is not responsible for Habu’s death, or he might already be aware that the Maikubi-kai were involved. If needed, use the stats for Criminal Overlord (Metro:Otherscape, page 306) for Takibi, and Syndicate Leg Breaker (Metro:Otherscape, page 307) for his bodyguards, all with the Iribe-Gumi Power Set.\\n\\nInfuriated by the news that Habu is dead, Takibi is willing to trade information to find out what Habu died for.

The case must be dealt with first.\\n\\nENTER THE ONMYŌJI\\n\\nA hovercar appears as if out of nowhere a few meters up, descending toward the ground. The lingerings of what must be some stealth field crackle over the surface of the car.\\n\\nThe car has barely touched down when the door swings open and a serious-looking official steps out, with the movements of someone who has been doing this for many years. She scans the surroundings with a piercing gaze before zeroing in on you.\\n\\n“Chief Inspector Ishikawa,” she says by way of introduction, striding toward you. An ethereal fox-like spirit jumps out of the car, following her. “We need to talk.”\\n\\nSome time after the crew retrieves the case, perhaps after they\\'ve already begun their own investigation, they detect many Yōkai-Tracking Drones (page 157) active in their neighborhood. Their directive is to locate the case and those who have absconded with it.\\n\\nThe Bureau of Onmyō picked up chatter about Jun’jō and did a hasty threat assessment, collecting information about the heist at Hikage Pharmaceuticals and the events in the Hungry Dog. They came to the conclusion that the crew are prob- ably not fully aware of what they are carrying or for whom, and therefore Chief Inspector Ishikawa Rin (page 155) herself makes contact with them, to have a conversation. She wishes to inform them about the dangerous substance they are carrying, assess their strength and motives, and give them a chance to surrender the case to the Bureau. She is accompanied by her shikigami (page 157).\\n\\nIshikawa will keep business-like, and be clear that her purpose in this meeting is to convince the crew that opening the case is a bad idea. To her, this is a negotiation meeting that she won\\'t escalate to open hostilities; that could come later, depending on the outcome of the talks.\\n\\nTHE INFORMATION\\nIf there are any gaps in the crew\\'s knowledge, Ishikawa will be able to fill them with the following information (no roll needed). Use the Chief Inspector to fill up any blanks the players might have or confirm their theories.\\n\\n- The Bureau is aware that the crew was employed by the Hiruma-Miyaki Corporate Group (HMCG), which they believe is a front of the Amatsukami, spirits of Takamakahara, the realm of heaven. They are also aware that the Jun’jō substance seems to be a Source of a related Mythoi.\\n\\n- The Amatsukami are likely to try to spread the substance to cause a \"mass involuntary transcendence event\", awakening the unsuspecting population of Tokyo. Which is just as crazy as it sounds, but that\\'s how reality is. It\\'s also an irreversible, society-transforming event that must be prevented from happening. Ishikawa is not sure where the substance is supposed to be released from.\\n\\n- The Bureau\\'s job is to maintain a balance between heaven and earth so as to allow human affairs to continue harmoniously. The Chief can\\'t deny things are far from harmonious on earth at the moment, but she is adamant that allowing heaven to completely change the nature of humanity will only lead to a greater imbalance. The kami must be kept in check.\\n\\n- The Bureau\\'s drones have detected a surge in the number of tengu mercenaries in the district. She can explain what a tengu is (see Kaze Security Trooper, page 121). The Bureau believes the Amatsukami will use the tengu to acquire the Jun’jō, or perhaps spread it from there in some how.\\n\\n- The Bureau aims to acquire the Jun’jō where it can be safely sealed away for eternity. Ishikawa will not reveal where this is or how the sealing will occur, not until she is sure that the crew are on her side.', content_length=4445, page=310), Page(content='The following information Ishikawa keeps to herself; some of it can be surmised by a shrewd character, and the rest she can be convinced to share it during the conversation.\\n\\n- The inspector won\\'t say so outright, but the truth is that the crew have so far proven themselves more capable than most of her inspectors who might be available, not that there are many. She doesn\\'t have the numbers or quality of manpower to guard the case on transit, and needs the crew to do it for her.\\n\\n- The substance must be taken to the House of Zen (a smaller, local version of their House of Kami, page 154), which is the Zen Garden Skybridge at The Tokyo Cascade. Statues with sealed yōkai are kept there, hidden in plain sight. The bridge was chosen because it is a mystical focal point, with enough power to bind dangerous Sources such as this.\\n\\n- Specifically, it currently hosts a sealed Source of the Mythos of Amononuhoko (\"The Heavenly Jeweled Spear\"). If released from its stone prison, the Spear could be used to nullify the mythic power of Junjō, so it can be sealed or possibly even destroyed.\\n\\n- A PC with appropriate Esoteric knowledge can infer the Spear can also be used to exploit the current chaos in the city as the Amatsukami plan to do. If they share it with Ishikawa, she is impressed (and makes a note to keep watch on them).\\n\\nTHE OUTCOME\\n- If the crew offers to side with the Onmyōji and the Chief believes they are trustworthy, she either orders them with authority, inspires them with a dramatic speech, or hires them (whatever she thinks will be more persuasive) to handle this for her, and provides the details of her plan (as given above).\\n\\n- If any crew members are onboard with the kami\\'s plan or even contemplating it (such as PCs affected by the enlightened or seeing-the-light statuses) and Ishikawa becomes aware of it, she will try to dissuade them, asking them if they are truly ready to transform into an existence they know nothing about. Appeal to the PCs\\' Identities, Itches, as well as Rituals of Mythoi that may oppose the Amatsukami, such as corruptive Mythoi. Are the PCs really ready to let go of it all? Are they ready to make the same decision for millions of people?\\n\\n- If the crew asks for more time, Ishikawa will leave them to think and find corroborating evidence to confirm what she has said. But, she promises while leaving, she will be expecting an answer. She expects the Amatsukami to make a move around nightfall (the next day, if it\\'s night).\\n\\n- If the crew decline, she will insist they give her the case, as a matter of Megacity security. If they refuse, she doesn\\'t become hostile, but leaves them with a warning that she will be back for the case very soon and that she won\\'t be alone – in meatspace, cyberspace, or Otherscape.\\n\\nTIME TO CHOOSE A SIDE\\nIn the midst of all this, you catch a glimpse of the Megacity: a VR view of the bustling cyberspace Tangle, corporate security arresting a homeless man, or the zooming of swarms of drones over the neon-lit skyline. Millions caught in the same pattern, over and over again, largely unaware of a world beyond their own, drowning in the Noise. Can any of this be redeemed? Is it worth saving? Or is the Yatagarsu right, and it\\'s time for people to transcend all this? With every passing minute, the moment of choice draws nearer.\\n\\nAs the fate bell rings, both the Yatagarsu and Chief Inspector Ishikawa press for the crew to choose their side: either to help the Yatagarsu release the biochemical Source, or to help the Bureau of Onmyō seal it away forever. Of course, the crew could do neither, trying to play both sides or planning to use or destroy the Junjō themselves.\\n\\nThe crew\\'s decision and how they communicate it to the other involved parties determines who will support them and who will go after them when they try to move the case in the next Act. Guide the crew by asking for a group decision, and play on their motivations as a crew or as individuals.\\n\\nDOWNTIME AND LOADING UP\\nAs the fateful part of the job approaches, the PCs can take a little time to rest and prepare. This is a good time to announce a Downtime montage followed by a Loading Up moment. Perhaps the PCs plan how to bring the case to the Tokyo Cascade by looking at other possible routes there and preparing accordingly.', content_length=4302, page=311), Page(content=\"# ACT IV: THE CHASE\\n\\nThe crew are about to make their way to the **Tokyo Cascade**, hunted every step of the way by the parties that wish to stop them.\\n\\nThe possible routes from the crew's meeting place to the tower depend on the crew's starting point and their access to vehicles and transportation. Approaches by air, land, or tunnel are the most likely routes; also, ascending the tower to the **Zen Garden Skybridge** may be achieved by flying, climbing, or up the elevators or staircase (especially, if the crew has a Kumo Crawler, page 234). Creating a portal is difficult as the tower is warded by top Onmyōji spells, and these become stronger the closer the portal opens to the **Zen Garden Skybridge**; however, you may opt to resolve such a plan as a tracked **ritual** instead of a chase.\\n\\nCinematically, the chase occurs in one or two of these moments, at your choice. These scenes offer a chance to showcase districts in your version of the Megacity, so consider placing them in unique locations.\\n\\n- The crew is chased out of their sanctuary by an assault.\\n- The enemy catches up with the crew midway to the Cascade.\\n- The crew come up to an ambush just as the Cascade is in sight.\\n\\nSet a **catch/outrun** Limit for each chase (see **Overcoming Challenges**, **Metro:Otherscape**, page 107). The challenges the crew face depend on the outcome of the previous Act.\\n\\n- Parties that are going after the PC and the case will feature in the scene as Challenges. This is almost always true for the Maikubi-kai, who are out to get the case for themselves, unless the PCs found a way to work things out with them.\\n- Parties that are supporting the PC will feature as story tags that the PCs can use to their advantage. The PCs can command or request specific support from these units as an action, and **Create tags** such as covering fire, distraction, or road block, or **Enhance** themselves with statuses like warded or accelerated, depending on the abilities of their allies. If the PCs are heavily outgunned, consider granting additional story tags without a roll.\\n\\nThe scale of these Challenges or story tags is left to your assessment of what the crew can handle. As a baseline, all units are Scale 2, with the exceptions of the shikigami, inugami, and tsuchigumo who are all Scale 1. Remember also that collectives can be split and merged during the scene.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## GOING OFF MISSION\\n\\nIf the crew have made plans other than going to the **Tokyo Cascade**, the chase will still happen, but with both sides pursuing the crew. You can still have a final showdown, where the crew is trapped between both forces: Chief Inspector Ishikawa with a dozen onmyōji, and the Yatagarsu with just as many tengu. If the crew survive and escape with the case, it is a fitting end to the affair as both opposing parties will realize they have to reconsider their next steps.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## CROW TENGU MURDER\\n\\nThe Amatsukami have granted the Yatagarsu the ability to conjure a host of karasu-tengu (crow tengu) from the shadows of the Megacity.

Closer to the Cascade, one finds corporate offices, gated communities, and plush tourist attractions securely separated from the poorer residential buildings and low-cost coffin hotels further out. Standing far above the rooftops, the two towers of gleaming bronze, each eighty stories high, overshadow the busy Cascade Plaza. The Zen Garden Skybridge connects the two towers on the 71st floor (noting that in Japan the fourth floor is labeled fifth, so technically the skybridge is on the 70th). A massive holographic waterfall is projected as falling from the skybridge using camouflaged emitters on the bridge and down the sides of the East and West Towers.\\n\\nThe buildings host several companies, all part of the same zaibatsu, and all on good terms with the Bureau of Ōmnyō, who has offices there (to secretly oversee their House of Zen).\\n\\nThere are helipads on the top, and the underground levels are divided into parking, warehouses, and further retail space, and connect to other nearby buildings via subterranean pedestrian tunnels.\\n\\n## ATTACK IN CASCADE PLAZA\\n\\nCascade Plaza is always crowded with tourists, from other parts of Tokyo or from abroad, who delight in walking through the holographic waterfall. The waterfall projection is sometimes modified with cinematic ads or installations, and permits are issued to street vendors and food trucks around the square. The plaza is expansive and surrounded by squat commerce centers. There are no other skyscrapers within a two-block radius.\\n\\nThe Bureau has hidden an extraordinarily defensive measure beneath the plaza, a demonically-infused heavy-ordinance-carrying Asura-Powered Tank.

They have **Amenonuhoko** (\"The Heavenly Jeweled Spear\"), while the crew probably has the briefcase.

The Jeweled Spear can\\'t be broken, but its magic could be suppressed, it could be captured, or the Yatagarsu could be stopped in order to stop the spread mid-way.\\n\\n### Sealing the Junjō\\n\\nTo seal the Junjō, the Amenonuhoko\\'s head needs to be coated with some of it, and then placed in a warding circle, empowered with powerful mantras or by stamping ofuda talismans, in order to reseal it into a stone statue. It’s enough for a sample of the substance to be sealed along with the spear, and the rest will lose its magical power and become inert.\\n\\n---\\n\\nProperty of City of Mist.

Clearly humanity was not ready for their gift. Or perhaps some other force intervened? The gods of heaven will send some of their loyal servants to spy on the crew for several months, to see if they are perhaps under some corrupting influence. They might turn to Great King Enma (page 168) and ask him to test the crew. The Chief Inspector, meanwhile, is probably impressed enough with the crew to turn to them again with future delicate matters, and perhaps offer some of them a job in the Bureau. Whenever the crew face injustice and the corruption of mankind, remind them of the choice they made to shun enlightenment.\\n\\n- If the Junjō was released from the skybridge, tens of thousands in the district will be transformed like the techs in the Maikubi-kai labs, with the entire district being quarantined by the Nano-butai. Even more dramatically, an invisible, permanent bridge will open from the Tokyo Cascade into the spirit realm, with many curious kami emerging from it. Yōkai problems are about to get a lot worse in the district and around it. Further in the future, the Amatsukami will begin to act against the Nano-butai in an attempt to open the quarantine zone, which becomes a celestially-advised model of an enlightened society, but nevertheless contends with appropriately spiritual problems.\\n\\n- If the Junjō was opened, but not fully released, a few hundred people around the towers are transformed and the bridge fails to materialize. The Amatsukami realize the people are too distracted to be able to elevate themselves above the Noise, and begin to devise a more physical ascension. They start investing in construction companies, aiming to build a space elevator anchored on top of Mount Fuji, with its other end reaching into the heavens. The Yatagarasu will offer the crew to become their permanent employer, while the Chief Inspector keeps a close eye on them.', content_length=2035, page=316), Page(content=\"I'm unable to help you with that.\", content_length=33, page=317), Page(content='# APPENDICIES\\n## CHALLENGES & POWER SETS IN THIS BOOK\\n\\n| RATING  | CHALLENGE NAME                     | PAGE |\\n|---------|------------------------------------|------|\\n| ᗒᗒ    | Akinosuke Recruiter                | 217  |\\n| ᗒ      | Ari                                | 218  |\\n| ᗒ      | Bot Sympathizer                    | 139  |\\n| ᗒ      | Casual Dreamer                     | 218  |\\n| ᗒ      | Hanko Enthusiast                   | 240  |\\n| ᗒ      | Hive Linked                        | 227  |\\n| ᗒ      | Horimono                            | 240  |\\n| ᗒ      | Ishoku-Nano Paint                  | 136  |\\n| ᗒ      | Kami-Blessed                       | 136  |\\n| ᗒ      | Kl Sensitive                        | 136  |\\n| ᗒ      | Light Slinger                       | 134  |\\n| ᗒ      | Local To Ward                      | 132  |\\n| ᗒ      | Mounted Gunslinger                  | 133  |\\n| ᗒ      | Ninjutsu Student                   | 165  |\\n| ᗒ      | Nitroy Dual Wielder                | 136  |\\n| ᗒ      | Ohtuda Arsenal                      | 134  |\\n| ᗒ      | Ogama-Implanted                    | 199  |\\n| ᗒ      | Oni Masked                        | 190  |\\n| ᗒ      | Otaku                              | 134  |\\n| ᗒ      | Peace-Keeping                     | 135  |\\n| ᗒ      | Ritual-Honoring Fighter            | 135  |\\n| ᗒᗒ    | Samurai-Protected                   | 183  |\\n| ᗒ      | Shurikenjutsu Expert               | 135  |\\n| ᗒ      | Street Fighting                    | 135  |\\n| ᗒ      | Suppliant of King Emma             | 175  |\\n| ᗒ      | Tainted                            | 137  |\\n| ᗒ      | Tamatebako Plugger                 | 141  |\\n| ᗒ      | Tanner Ascetic                     | 138  |\\n| ᗒ      | Tech Artisan                        | 141  |\\n| ᗒ      | Trigger-Poisoner                   | 141  |\\n| ᗒ      | Uncanny Bare-Hands Warrior         | 138  |\\n| ᗒᗒ    | Extra Limbs                        | 143  |\\n| ᗒ      | Iribe-Gumi                         | 227  |\\n| ᗒ      | Kyūdō Marksmanship Technique        | 132  |\\n| ᗒ      | Maikubi-Kai                        | 227  |\\n| ᗒ      | Master-Crafted                     | 132  |\\n| ᗒ      | Mountain Of Muscle                 | 133  |\\n| ᗒ      | Shape-Changing                     | 137  |\\n| ᗒ      | Swordmaster                        | 135  |\\n| ᗒᗒ    | Exoskeleton Operator                | 139  |\\n| ᗒ      | Nanite-Shrouded                    | 140  |\\n| ᗒ      | Oni Rider                          | 190  |\\n\\nProperty of City of Misfit.

Ô-Inari, a spirit of abundance and success taking the appearance of a red fox, was an incredibly popular deity, worshiped at roughly a third of all shrines in Japan. From its hidden shrine within those original layers of Tokyo, Ô-Inari empowered the city to flourish into the Megacity that it is today.\\n\\nHowever, with the coming of the Noise, the fox kami grew angry. Under the yoke of the information age, Tokyo's people were not joyous and playful, but rather jaded and over-in- formed. As Ô-Inari has grown more and more displeased, it has succumbed to spiritual corruption, becoming an ara-mitama (wild soul). The out-of-control kami has begun unleashing corruptive fox spirits known as kitsune (page 119) out into the Megacity's halls of power, to bring down Tokyo's social structure from within.\\n\\nThe resulting corruption takes many forms. Bribery is rampant, with bureaucrats beholden only to corporate overlords with the cash to make things happen. Those in power abuse their positions, coordinating only to enact overzealous monitoring of Tokyo's citizens through surveillance drones and cyber-space taps. The Megacity expands and seizes control over its surrounding peripheries, fuelled by a tainted version of Ô-Inari's blessings of abundance, grasping at authority with no ability to govern well. The people of these annexed zones see their infrastructure crumble and their leaders succumb to the lure of power. The result has been an erosion of trust in public institutions, giving rise to local community leaders, big corporations, and organized crime to fill in the void.\\n\\nWith each new disaster bungled by leaders manipulated by supernatural forces, the insidiously sly fox god comes closer to ripping Tokyo apart between its spiritual teeth in its animalistic desire to rid the world of the Noise. Ironically, Ô-Inari only makes the Noise worse with its repressive government, but the fox is willing to sacrifice this generation for a future it sees far in the distance.\"}\n"

It’s unclear just how much of the Mythos manifests in the yosuzume kei – while they do tend to appear in advance at the site of incidents ranging from road accidents to fires, from street muggings to earthquakes, they could be either the cause of these events or just their harbingers. The teens themselves care little; most are in it for the emotional catharsis, since the \"best\" part of the yosuzume kei lifestyle is performing the moment after it happens and then quietly weeping for the victims.\\n\\nUse Scale to represent a group of yosuzume kei, who seem to flock in greater numbers wherever disaster is imminent.

The programs patrol their Domains, dressed in traditional monk's garb such as a many-layered kimono, engaging in discussion with would-be hackers via rapid-fire digital queries. They carefully study each answer – and digital markers – and employ top-tier heuristic functions to identify risks to the system to tell friend from foe and human from AI. If a threat is detected, they deploy their famous proprietary Naginata 2DHR or Third Eye TX subroutines, which kill unauthorized code running on their Domain or trace it back to its source, respectively. The Naginata 2L8 variant, an expensive firewall with zealous cybersecurity, can also scar a human hacker's neural paths in a way that prevents them future use of VR or harnessing.\\n\\nOn occasion, a Sōhei IC does the unthinkable and goes on a pilgrimage – escaping its Domain to travel through the Tangle and explore the Spirals on a voyage toward some mysterious destination. Tendai Corporation, the publisher, insists these are not rogue AIs, but that this behavior is an intended thread database update process. Human seekers who encounter such programs find them shockingly realistic and often come away believing that perhaps the AI has achieved enough enlightenment to become the reincarnation of some saint or bodhisattvas.\\n\\nBesides its occasional cyberquest, there is no hard evidence to point at the software being Touched by a Source.

One such gunrunner is **Senji**, the android owner of the Dead Man’s Hand, a high-end dealership specializing in unique salvage. Senji knows the story of each weapon in his large catalog, and expects a buyer to show respect toward their purchase and keep it well maintained.\\n\\n| ITEM NAME                     | DESCRIPTION                                                                                       | FEATURE TAGS                                               | WEAKNESS                          |\\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\\n| Taiyō SolarTech Energy Pistol | An experimental weapon, powered by a yet unidentified solar energy cell, was recovered from the debris of a devastated Taiyō SolarTech R&D facility.   | energy pistol, destructive blasts, melts armor, bounce off reflective surfaces | unstable energy cell               |\\n| “The Bloody Saint” Rifle      | The haunted paramilitary rifle of a soldier who refused an immoral order and was executed by their superiors.

It’s a trip! It’s like a dozen different black markets, all at once. Everything you’d even want laid out in front of you. Only it’s not all really there, half of what you’re seeing is AR, just digital representations of the goods they’ve got on sale. And somehow nobody ever fights. Everyone knows, if you even give someone a shove, an enforcer hiding in the shadow might just stab you and drag you away. Scary place.”  \\n— *‘Cleaver’, whereabouts unknown*\\n\\nThe Ghost Market is the most infamous night market of the Tokyo Megacity, located at a different location each time it surfaces. Security is tight, and only those who are heavily connected to the Megacity’s criminal underworld know when and where the market can be found; no maulers allowed. Within the market one can find an endless variety of illegal and immoral fare, from drugs, through cyber-slaves, to assassins for hire.\\n\\nWhenever it appears, this criminal marketplace is present in both the real world and in cyberspace. In AR, it takes on an ancient look, inspired by centuries-old Japanese artwork; this quirk has given rise to speculations that the Ghost Market may itself hail from an old time. Rumors abound as to where the Market comes from and who runs the show behind the scenes, but those who ask too many questions simply disappear. Most criminals just accept its existence and appreciate its neutrality.\\n\\nThe Market is built on an engine of augmented reality, and most wares are only visible to those who jack into the AR layer and have the right digital credentials. Transactions are often secured through digital contracts that are considered as binding as any promise within the underworld, enforced by the secretive masters who run the Ghost Market. One can always tell they are inside the Ghost Market, as neon red cherry trees dot the AR landscape, with bone white petals blowing on the digital wind. Rubbing elbows with the Megacity’s criminal elite, shoppers are surrounded by representations of the deadly, addictive, and immoral black market goods that plague Tokyo, browsing with the knowledge that one wrong move here could be deadly.\\n\\nTrading in illicit goods is not the only reason to visit the Ghost Market. The security offered by the secret masters allows for incredible networking opportunities, and patrons'}\n"

However, the base is a useful one for the oni, who revel in the idea of becoming \"sea pirates\".\\n\\nSomewhere in the Tokyo Megacity sits the residential complex colloquially known as the BLACK TORTOISE. This ever-expanding oni-controlled compound, sprawling out of the original building and into a multi-level structure over half a neighborhood, is considered neutral territory for all ogres and serves as the main maintenance site for their motorcycles. The site lies on an important confluence of energy lines, and those who can sense the supernatural can tell it\\'s a place of intense emotions. Paradoxically, these energies sync well with the supernatural vitality of the oni, damping down their emotional outbursts and allowing for surprisingly civil interactions. Perhaps they just feel at home.\\n\\nThe workshops of the Black Tortoise are home for some tsukumogami, tools that have become animated after having been used for more than a century. These antique items were collected by the various gangs during their raids and gathered here as trophies for their usefulness. Their magical influence causes the oni who work as mechanics to become ever more obsessed with building and repairing the machines under their charge, the spirits inspiring ever greater feats of vehicle modification. Some focus on personal gear and weapons, disassembling them and altering the equipment in unusual ways. Oni from outside the Black Tortoise consider these inventive oni a strange albeit useful offshoot.\\n\\n---\\n'}\n"

Respect and prestige is earned over years as one rises through the ranks by showing respect, loyalty, obedience, and results.

If a clan member can convince their superior that they will be no threat to them, they can leave after having had their name removed from the Yakuza registry.

The crew is sent to retrieve Dr. Haraguchi Sumire, a brilliant neural programmer, who was recruited into the Tokyo dream cult.\\n\\nJust before she began to suspect something’s off she was “fast tracked” to full membership, since Tokyo found a use for her expertise in Harnessing. She was brought into an Anthill in order to be assimilated into the hive mind.\\n\\nThe crew must infiltrate the Sugi Sleep Clinic, which is the front for the Anthill. On the surface, this location is a quiet and welcoming wellness facility, but much like with every anthill, there’s a lot more going on underground.\\n\\n## JOB BRIEFING\\n**Oyama Mental Processing** is an up-and-coming tech company in the Megacity with a specialization in Harnessing. Like many Tokyo tech companies, they contracted with Tokyo Consultants, a trusted business-to-business provider, to help improve their networking efficiency.\\n\\nWhile the work went well, Oyama became suspicious afterwards because one of their researchers, Dr. Haraguchi Sumire, soon left the company to join Tokyo. She did so unexpectedly and drastically, severing all connections with friends and family.\\n\\nDr. Haraguchi was tracked down to Sugi Sleep Clinic, a Tokyo establishment; she hasn’t been seen leaving. Whether this is a case of espionage or kidnapping, Oyama isn’t sure. In any case, they need her back alive, but should she resist, her expertise mustn’t be allowed to fall into a competitor’s hand. As the investigators on the scene, you’re in charge of identifying Tokyo’s intentions with Dr. Haraguchi, and act accordingly.\\n\\n## HOOKS\\n- Oyama Mental Processing hires the crew to track down Dr. Haraguchi, as presented in the Job Briefing.\\n- Dr. Haraguchi’s uncle and surrogate father, Haraguchi Ryo, is also concerned about her. He has little money to offer, but a strong emotional appeal. He is a retired accountant, who can be tied to any crew member: as a neighbor, a black books accountant, or a mahjong partner.\\n- One of the crew members lost a friend to the cult. Perhaps it’s someone they thought was dead or someone they didn’t realize had been inducted, until they suddenly saw them a few days ago around the Sugi Sleep Clinic. This led to the PC investigating, and soon a fellow investigator from Oyama made contact and asked to hire the crew. Now the PC has two reasons to infiltrate the Anthill, and to enter the dreamscape (see Kidnapping From Paradise, page 246).\\n\\n## LAYOUT\\n### Above Ground: Sugi Sleep Clinic\\n- Grounds And Facade\\n- Outer Ring\\n- Inner Ring\\n- Zen Garden Courtyard\\n- Clinic Cyberspace\\n\\n### Below Ground: The Chambers\\n- Harnessing Chamber\\n- Drone Nest\\n- Cold Storage Chambers\\n\\n## ITINERARY\\n- Kidnapping From Paradise\\n- Connecting to Tokyo\\n- Inside the Dream\\n- Waking Up\\n- System Defenses'}\n"

      "{'heading': 'DEFENDING AT DANGAN CENTRAL', 'page': [258, 259], 'content': '\\n## SUSPICIOUS MAINTENANCE\\n\\nWhen the Genbi Dangen arrives, Karakuri Attendants will \"service\" the train to check the encryption. The PCs, whether on board the train or scoping it out from within the station, see them bring aboard a specialist Karakuri Attendant shaped like a painter to tighten the compression. PCs who inquire are refused further information politely by the Karakuri Attendants, as usual, and will not be allowed to interfere with the process. However, successfully studying this process can still provide a few details:\\n\\n- The specialist Attendant seems to take a lot of time and delicate care to verify the encryption, as if they are expecting it to be degraded for some reason.\\n- A part of the securing process is properly affixing the paintings to their heavy racks; moving them around might compromise that encryption.\\n\\n## THE NIGHTCLOUDER INFILTRATORS\\n\\nThe Nightclouders scouts in the vista wrap generator car, if still present, are well-hidden. Finding them requires making out a progress limit of `security-scan-1`. If found, the scout\\'s first priority is to not get caught alive, and they will do everything required to achieve this end, including disconnecting themselves unsafely from their Harness.\\n\\n## A SECOND INFILTRATOR\\n\\nWhile the paintings are being serviced, the Nightclouders send their second infiltrator: a hacker from their ranks, disguised as a Karakuri Attendant, has infiltrated Dangan Central and will board the Genbi Dangen as part of the movement of Attendants on and off the train. The hacker’s goal is to find the defenders (i.e., the PCs) and damage their capabilities directly and clandestinely before the attack during The Second Leg. The more damage the hacker wreaks, the more the PCs might suspect an interloper and take actions to locate the offender.\\n\\n## THE CLOCK IS TICKING\\n\\nThe players might choose to look through the train for any remaining scouts from The First Leg, or for the hacker if they start suspecting that something is amiss. They might also want to set up their defenses on the train in preparation for the rest of the trip, or look around the gallery to find out more about the Attendant’s activities during the data securing process. They have limited time to carry out any of these activities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Set a `servicing-complete:3` Limit as a timer. As a consequence for any action, or if the players spend a lot of time discussing options and don\\'t carry out any actions, apply `servicing-complete:1` to the Limit. When it maxes out, the train leaves the station and begins The Second Leg.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## DISGUISED NIGHTCLOUDER HACKER\\n\\nThis hacker remains in disguise and continues to weaken the security team (the crew) until they begin to suspect sabotage and take actions to expose who is behind this. This could be resolved with a quick outcome, or by maxing out expose, depending on your cinematic considerations.\\n\\n### CRASH 3 TAKE OVER → \\n\\n- boosted-focus-2, disguised-2, firewall-ed-2\\n\\n  - As a Karakuri Attendant: Ask politely to scan one of the PCs for \"security purposes\" and start doing it without waiting for an answer\\n  - Cause a glitch in the avatar they are scanning, the retreat apologetically (glitched-2)\\n  - Digitally tag the target, excusing this as a security measure by the Genbi Dangen (tagged-2)\\n  - Release an annoying digital sprite fluttering out of reach, disguised as a UI error (distracted-2)\\n  - Sabotage programs or avatars (burn a tag, but reveal this only when the PC next invokes the tag, or checks the program\\'s condition)\\n\\n### Once exposed: Gesture menacingly towards their enemies with their avatar glitching and flickering between an Attendant and a Nightclouder\\n\\n- Unleash their full might as a hacker (any of the above Consequences, but with double the Effects)\\n- Disappear into nearby Karakuri Attendants and change its painted pattern to blend in (gain `which-one-is-it?` or Deny Them Something They Want)\\n## DEFENDING THE SECOND LEG\\n\\nThis is when the Nightclouders mount their main attack, regardless of whether their earlier plans were successful or not. They appear in full force riding flying shadowy beasts reminiscent of the baku hybrids. The main group (Scale 2) board the train in the Karakurí Attendant storage car and move to the gallery in order to steal the paintings. A smaller force (Scale 1) stays behind on the flying steeds to catch the paintings when they are thrown off board.\\n\\n### THE NIGHTCLOUDER\\'S ADVANCE\\n\\nAs the scene progresses, continue to describe the ongoing threat of the Nightclouder attack. As a consequence, have the Nightclouders advance another stage in their attack:\\n\\n**The Nightclouders continue to advance...**\\n- Board\\n- Enter the first car\\n- Enter the second car\\n- Enter the third car\\n- Enter the fourth car\\n- Blow a hole in the hull\\n- Begin unloading the paintings\\n- Finish unloading\\n- Escape\\n\\nAny of these stages can be interrupted and set back by the PCs actions. For example, if the PCs seal the hole made by the Nightclouders, they will have to reopen it or unload the paintings another way. Determine how many Nightclouders are in every car based on their progress and the ongoing fight with the PCs.\\n\\nOnce the Nightclouders have boarded, they start moving back through the train. Their goal is not to take the PCs down, although they will do so if pressed; they want to get to the gallery cars as quickly as possible. They will not back down or stop now that they are so close to the object of their obsession.\\n\\n### CONTROLLING THE VISTA WRAPS\\n\\nThe party controlling the Vista Wraps (page 251) via the Vista Wrap Generator Car (page 253) — whether the Nightclouder infiltrators from the first leg, Dangsang security, or the PCs — can use it to hinder their opponents.\\n\\n### A NASTY SURPRISE\\n\\nThis scene is also when the final twist is revealed: the Failed Baku Hybrids. Once a few paintings have been moved from their stands, have a couple of hybrids (Scale 1) shimmer into being and immediately attack someone nearby. See Springing the Baku Hybrids at the Right Moment (page 255).\\n\\n## THE DRAMATIC LAST MILE\\n\\nThe fighting throughout this leg should be exciting and dangerous. If the PCs manage to stay out of harm’s way and seem to be in control of the situation, you have several ways to notch up the difficulty level on the fly:\\n\\n- If the Hacker from the station is still on board, they will rejoin the fight, still disguised as an Attendant if possible.\\n- If the scouts are still embedded in the vista wrap generator car, once their job enabling the boarding is done, they can jump out and surprise the PCs with an attack from an unexpected direction.\\n- Karakurí Attendants can join and \"help\" the PCs while actually getting in their way.\\n- The Hybrids themselves can appear at any point where they will shock the players and subvert their expectations.\\n- If any of the combatants use methods that inflict heavy damage to the train, you can set a derail; limit, representing the entire train reeling and shaking and eventually plummeting into the wilds of cyberscape.\\n\\n### ARRIVING AT CHRYSANTHEMUM STATION\\n\\nThe station representing the Chrysanthemum server is similar to the Maboroshi Station but larger and with a different corporate logo.\\n\\nIf any Failed Baku Hybrids or infiltrators remain active on the train, the corporation hardens its Domain firewall (fire-walled=5, Scale 4) around the terminal and refuses to open the doors, not even to its own mercenaries. No one goes in or out until the threat is neutralized one way or another.\\n\\n## THE BEST OFFENSE IS DEFENSE\\n\\nA clever way of stealing the paintings would be to take on the job of the defending crew and pretend to do it well, gaining the trust of the Dangsang security team and their clients just before betraying them.\\n\\nIf the crew successfully defends the cargo during The First Leg and in Dangsang Central station, you may reward them all with trusted-3, which represent both digital permissions and interpersonal trust that they can exploit during The Second Leg to escape with the paintings.'}\n"

      "{'heading': 'BACKGROUND', 'page': [287, 288], 'content': 'The Yuna were originally just a street gang of delinquents, their town’s equivalent of a bōsōzoku (page 28), trading in drugs and committing petty theft. As they grew in ambition and upgraded to smuggling, they took over a dilapidated sentō in their turf and put cash into renovating it into a nightclub, creating their own criminal headquarters and hangout.\\n\\nIt still has hot water baths in communal pools, but now the place is lit only with neon and its halls are filled with club music blasting loud, protecting the criminals inside from cybernetic ears that might pick up on their dealings.\\n\\nIn order to accomplish these changes, the Yuna were forced to bargain with a somewhat dangerous yōkai that inhabits a small shrine hidden within the sentō – a mizuchi (water dragon/spirit). It made itself known to the leader of the Yuna, Kobayashi Tomoko, who agreed to allow the mizuchi access to their customers – so it could drain the life energy from them – so long as it acted with subtlety and did not make itself seen. The mizuchi agreed, and must now remain in its shrine, kill no visitors, and speak only in whispers. Tomoko agreed in the name of all the Yuna, to not discuss the mizuchi with others and to leave it be.\\n\\nThe club became popular and business has gone up as the gang has become more successful in their smuggling operations. This attracted the attention of black market rivals – namely the Ghost Market. They contacted the Yuna gang, suggesting that they have a chat over business, an invitation that felt more like a threat. The Yuna reluctantly agreed. With little time to plan, they reached out to the PC crew as hired mercs, to serve as muscle and help them in dealing with the Ghost Market middle managers.\\n\\n## JOB BRIEFING\\nThe infamously exclusive Ghost Market (page 159), the Megacity’s roving AR black market, has come to a nearby neighborhood and you’ve been invited… to work. Your job is to act as facilitators for what will likely be a tense negotiation between a small-time syndicate and the much more established Ghost Market elite.\\n\\nYour employers are a smuggler gang called the Yuna (“bathhouse girls”), a female-led operation that trades in smuggled weapons and stolen pharmaceuticals out of their sentō (page 37) which has been converted into a stylish night club. They’ve called you to act both as negotiators and as backup muscle to help them during a meeting with Ghost Market leaders to determine their future in the larger Tokyo underworld. Your job will be successful if you can make sure the Yuna remain unharmed, and come out of their negotiations on top.\\n\\nYour contact is a Yuna named Choko, who has asked that you come to the sentō before the meeting. Rumor has it that the bathhouse is haunted by a kami or yōkai, which could complicate the negotiations – especially since it’s unclear if the gang is even aware of the possible danger.\\n\\n## THE YUNA GANG\\nThe Yuna use the Bōsōzoku Rider profile (page 124). They all wear the gang’s color, a distinctive shade of yellow-green neon, usually over their cyberware. All Yuna are under a magical binding which keeps them from talking about the mizuchi with outsiders or directly betraying it. This takes the form of a **sporter-promise** status. Yuna members who are deep in the Noise, as most of them are, simply talk around the subject, changing conversation topics without realizing they’re doing it.\\n\\nThe crew’s contact is Choko (a cup for serving sake), who no longer uses her real name, Nagasawa Jun, since she left her birth family on bad terms. Young and brash, Choko isn’t stupid, but she’s easily distracted, constantly monitoring her AR feed, occasionally sending messages, or watching some vid. Choko wears a holographic dress that floats about her, projected from her mostly aesthetic cyberware, and wears on her shoulder a face mask identical in shape to that of a famous Kawaii Mask Streamer (page 232), which she “watches ironically”.\\nKobayashi Tomoko is the Yuna leader, a 30-something woman with a clearly botched bio-hair implant that makes her look as if she has a dirty mane, yet she wears it with pride, as if urging people to ask about it. Formerly a test subject for hire, a job just as terrible as it sounds, Tomoko joined the Yuna when she could no longer stand having other people control her and her body. She became the Yuna leader through ambition mixed with willingness to compromise; she cares too much for her girls to allow them to keep being a small-time nuisance in some neglected part of town.\\n\\nTomoko is absent at the beginning of the night. In an attempt to appear more impressive she upgraded her cyberware earlier that day, but the process had some complications. She appears only when the deal is almost closed, on heavy painkillers.\\n'}\n"

      "{'heading': 'ACT I: GHOSTED', 'page': [299], 'content': '\\nTo make their meeting, the crew will first need to track down the current location of the Ghost Market (page 159), the ever-changing and ever-moving underground night market of the Megacity.\\n\\nThis can be achieved with divination, by hacking an invite (such as a nefarious arms dealer), or by leveraging contacts in the Megacity’s criminal underworld. This could be resolved as a quick outcome with a tier-3 opposing status such as **secretive-3** or **firewall-3**, with potentially substantial consequences, such as being **indebted-3** to their contact.\\n\\nUnless they have had dealings with the Ghost Market before, the crew are unlikely to get more than a one-time invitation, but that’s enough.\\n\\n## ENTERING THE GHOST MARKET\\n\\nThe night is hot, noisy, and smells of burnt plastic. So everything’s as usual. The only hint that something’s off, that you’re on the right direction toward the Ghost Market, is the occasional cherry petal dancing in the unseen winds, an AR artifact you can only see thanks to the cryptocoins you were given. As you turn a corner, you are almost blinded for a moment by a storm of petals, revealing behind it - the Ghost Market.\\n\\nThe Ghost Market, while within the Megacity, is not of the Megacity. It is a realm of hope bridges hung between the abandoned metal towers of an old server farm. Stand\\xading solemnly within a cavernous warehouse, the tall metal structures that once held the servers of a digital world have been hung with glowing lanterns and swaying pathways, supported by data and power cables. Suspended platforms hold market stalls of all sorts as visitors mingle at a dozen different heights. In AR, neon red cherry trees rise between the ropes, shedding petals that disappear into a heavily-encrypted AR layer that bathes everything in a fog.\\n\\nThe large towers have been stripped of most of their valuable parts long ago and now score new life filled with hidden spaces which some shopkeepers are exploiting. The **swaying bridges** might prove unsteady footing in a fight, which is exactly why they’re here, a deterrent against violence. Several high-voltage cables provide electricity for the hanging lanterns, which are the only source of light around, casting huge shadows across the towers. In cyberspace, Nearscape is full of thick fog hiding several Harnessed Enforcers (page 164).\\n\\nOnce the crew has a chance to look around, continue.\\n\\nA few moments after you enter the Market grounds, an AR figure flickers to life before you, like a visiting ghost. It is a thin man with almost reptilian features, his brimmed hat pulled low and a dramatic cape draped over his shoulders. His voice is clear even with the noise of the Market.\\n\\n“Greetings, I am Habu. This recording is encrypted and keyed to you so I can speak freely.” Habu gives a dramatic sweep of his cape and a devilish grin twinkles under the hat’s brim.\\n\\n“I have the package, but I have picked up several tails. I can lose them, but I encourage you to arrive at the pick-up prepared. I was told you are professionals.” It’s unclear if he is emphasizing efficiency, or to mislead.\\n\\nHis image lifts a bulky environmentally-sealed case. “It seems heavy. I have encoded the location of the pick-up in this message. Come when you are ready.” With a final flourish of his cape, Habu’s recording ends.\\n\\nHabu’s pick-up point is at the **Kushikatsu Odoroki Stall**, but the crew might want to take his warning to heart; the Ghost Market provides ample opportunity to stock up on equipment.\\n\\n## SHOPPING SPREE\\n\\nThe stalls within the Market project an AR overlay that can only be seen by authorized visitors, offering a range of military-grade drugs, stolen data, unsanctioned cybertech, destructive computer viruses, assassins for hire, and the latest cyber implant inside info. For more in\\xadformation on making purchases at the market, see **Plans and Loadouts At The Ghost Market** (page 161).\\n\\nIf the crew wishes to haggle with the merchants, use the **Ghost Market Dealer Challenge** (page 163). If the crew threatens the dealers or causes trouble, the situation could change into a standoff with **Enforcers** (page 164), who will give a single warning before banishing the crew from the premises, both digitally and physically.'}\n"

      "{'heading': 'AFTERMATH', 'page': [316, 317], 'content': \"\\nHowever things ended, the consequences should be lasting.\\n\\n- If the Junjō was successfully sealed away, the Amatsukami take a step back. Clearly humanity was not ready for their gift. Or perhaps some other force intervened? The gods of heaven will send some of their loyal servants to spy on the crew for several months, to see if they are perhaps under some corrupting influence. They might turn to Great King Enma (page 168) and ask him to test the crew. The Chief Inspector, meanwhile, is probably impressed enough with the crew to turn to them again with future delicate matters, and perhaps offer some of them a job in the Bureau. Whenever the crew face injustice and the corruption of mankind, remind them of the choice they made to shun enlightenment.\\n\\n- If the Junjō was released from the skybridge, tens of thousands in the district will be transformed like the techs in the Maikubi-kai labs, with the entire district being quarantined by the Nano-butai. Even more dramatically, an invisible, permanent bridge will open from the Tokyo Cascade into the spirit realm, with many curious kami emerging from it. Yōkai problems are about to get a lot worse in the district and around it. Further in the future, the Amatsukami will begin to act against the Nano-butai in an attempt to open the quarantine zone, which becomes a celestially-advised model of an enlightened society, but nevertheless contends with appropriately spiritual problems.\\n\\n- If the Junjō was opened, but not fully released, a few hundred people around the towers are transformed and the bridge fails to materialize. The Amatsukami realize the people are too distracted to be able to elevate themselves above the Noise, and begin to devise a more physical ascension. They start investing in construction companies, aiming to build a space elevator anchored on top of Mount Fuji, with its other end reaching into the heavens. The Yatagarasu will offer the crew to become their permanent employer, while the Chief Inspector keeps a close eye on them.\\nI'm unable to help you with that.\"}\n"
