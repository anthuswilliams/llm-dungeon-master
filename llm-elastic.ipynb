The spell ends if the\\n\\ncreature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn’t affected.\\n\\nWhile in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The\\n\\ntarget has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through\\n\\nsmall holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can’t fall and remains hovering\\n\\nin the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.\\n\\nWhile in the form of a misty cloud, the target can’t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or\\n\\notherwise interacted with. The target can’t attack or cast spells.\\n\\nGate\\n\\n9th-level conjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 60 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp)\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\\n\\nYou conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular\\n\\nopening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.\\n\\nThe portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does\\n\\nso is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.\\n\\nDeities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.\\n\\nWhen you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other\\n\\nthan the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on\\n\\nyour side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help\\n\\nyou.\\n\\nGeas\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While\\n\\nthe creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once\\n\\neach day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.\\n\\nYou can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.\\n\\nYou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th\\n\\nlevel, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.\\n\\nGentle Repose\\n\\n2nd-level necromancy (ritual)\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse’s eyes, which must remain there for the duration)\\n\\nDuration: 10 days\\n\\nYou touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead.\\n\\nThe spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against\\n\\nthe time limit of spells such as raise dead.\\n\\nGiant Insect\\n\\n4th-level transmutation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 30 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\\n\\nYou transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A\\n\\ncentipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.\\n\\nEach creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round.

You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor\\n\\nor wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger\\n\\nthan 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without\\n\\nbeing triggered.\\n\\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\\n\\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the\\n\\nglyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is\\n\\ninscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the\\n\\nobject, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\\n\\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or\\n\\nweight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t\\n\\ntrigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\\n\\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured.

You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the\\n\\nsuggestion mentally.\\n\\nThe whole warded area radiates magic.

The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius\\n\\nincludes an area already under the effect a hallow spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.\\n\\nFirst, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any\\n\\ncreature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude\\n\\none or more of those types of creatures from this effect.\\n\\nSecond, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the DM. Some of these effects\\n\\napply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of\\n\\na specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can\\n\\nmake a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.\\n\\nCourage. Affected creatures can’t be frightened while in the area.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the\\n\\nspell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it\\n\\ndoesn’t age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target.\\n\\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.\\n\\nBurial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through\\n\\nthe sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.\\n\\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.\\n\\nChaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by\\n\\nany means until then.\\n\\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.\\n\\nHedged Prison. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a\\n\\nlabyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.\\n\\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\\n\\nMinimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the\\n\\ngemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or\\n\\nplanar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.\\n\\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\\n\\nSlumber. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\\n\\nEnding the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target.\\n\\nThe condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to\\n\\npass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based\\n\\non intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.\\n\\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.\\n\\nYou can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the\\n\\nfirst casting is immediately freed from its binding.\\n\\nIncendiary Cloud\\n\\n8th-level conjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

       " \"MONK RANGER\\n\\nPaladin\\n\\nClad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on\\n\\na mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.\\n\\nA dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory.\\n\\nSilently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.\\n\\nSilver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and\\n\\nagain at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.\\n\\nWhatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the\\n\\nwitness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a\\n\\npaladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.\\n\\nThe Cause of Righteousness\\n\\nA paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces\\n\\nof evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power\\n\\nto do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it\\n\\ndoes from a god.\\n\\nPaladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical\\n\\npower they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight\\n\\nfor justice.\\n\\nBeyond the Mundane Life\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin\\n\\nlives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer\\n\\npeople can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight\\n\\nevil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of\\n\\nrighteousness, not to crown and country.\\n\\nAdventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of\\n\\ntreasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.\\n\\nCreating a Paladin\\n\\nThe most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don’t appear until\\n\\nyou reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the\\n\\ngods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything\\n\\nbeautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner\\n\\nsworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists\\n\\nmany deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut,\\n\\nAthena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.\\n\\nHow did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin\\n\\nsense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event — the destruction of your home, perhaps — drive you to your\\n\\nquests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty.\\n\\nOr you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin’s life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that\\n\\npurpose stamped on your soul.\\n\\nAs guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how\\n\\nyour alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and\\n\\nalignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.\\n\\nQuick Build\\n\\nYou can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions.

As an action, you can\\n\\nopen your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you\\n\\nthat is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire\\n\\nCount Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or\\n\\ndesecrated, as with the hallow spell.\\n\\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.\\n\\nLay on Hands\\n\\nYour blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total\\n\\nnumber of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.\\n\\nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount\\n\\nremaining in your pool.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure\\n\\nmultiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.\\n\\nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs.\\n\\nFighting Style\\n\\nAt 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once,\\n\\neven if you later get to choose again.\\n\\nDefense\\n\\nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\\n\\nDueling\\n\\nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.\\n\\nGreat Weapon Fighting\\n\\nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must\\n\\nuse the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.\\n\\nProtection\\n\\nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack\\n\\nroll. You must be wielding a shield.\\n\\nSpellcasting\\n\\nBy 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules\\n\\nof spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.\\n\\nPreparing and Casting Spells\\n\\nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must\\n\\nexpend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\\n\\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin\\n\\nspells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have\\n\\nspell slots.\\n\\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can\\n\\ninclude four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\\n\\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation:\\n\\nat least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\\n\\nSpellcasting Ability\\n\\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma\\n\\nwhenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you\\n\\ncast and when making an attack roll with one.\\n\\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\\n\\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\\n\\nSpellcasting Focus\\n\\nYou can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.\\n\\nDivine Smite\\n\\nStarting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to\\n\\nthe weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage\\n\\nincreases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.\\n\\nDivine Health\\n\\nBy 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.\\n\\nSacred Oath\\n\\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the\\n\\npath but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class\\n\\ndescription.\\n\\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.\\n\\nOath Spells\\n\\nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath\\n\\nspell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\\n\\nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.\\n\\nChannel Divinity\\n\\nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.\\n\\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\\n\\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.\\n\\nAbility Score Improvement\\n\\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability\\n\\nscores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\\n\\nExtra Attack\\n\\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You must be conscious to grant this bonus.\\n\\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\\n\\nAura of Courage\\n\\nStarting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.\\n\\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\\n\\nImproved Divine Smite\\n\\nBy 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with\\n\\na melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.\\n\\nCleansing Touch\\n\\nBeginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.\\n\\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.\\n\\nSacred Oaths\\n\\nBecoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath,\\n\\ntaken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true\\n\\npaladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has\\n\\nalways been true in the paladin’s heart.\\n\\nOath of Devotion\\n\\nThe Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these\\n\\npaladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest\\n\\nstandards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of\\n\\nlaw and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels — the perfect servants of good — as their ideals, and\\n\\nincorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.\\n\\nTenets of Devotion\\n\\nThough the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.\\n\\nHonesty. Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.\\n\\nOath Spells\\n\\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\\n\\nOath of Devotion Spells\\n\\nPaladin Level Spells\\n\\n3rd protection from evil and good, sanctuary\\n\\n5th lesser restoration, zone of truth\\n\\n9th beacon of hope, dispel magic\\n\\n13th freedom of movement, guardian of faith\\n\\n17th commune, flame strike\\n\\nChannel Divinity\\n\\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.\\n\\nSacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your\\n\\nCharisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim\\n\\nlight 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.\\n\\nYou can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect\\n\\nends.\\n\\nTurn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or\\n\\nundead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or\\n\\nuntil it takes damage.\\n\\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also\\n\\ncan’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move,\\n\\nthe creature can use the Dodge action.\\n\\nAura of Devotion\\n\\nStarting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious.\\n\\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\\n\\nPurity of Spirit\\n\\nBeginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell.\\n\\nHoly Nimbus\\n\\nAt 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet\\n\\nbeyond that.\\n\\nWhenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.\\n\\nIn addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.\\n\\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights,\\n\\npaladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving\\n\\nthings of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of\\n\\ngrowing things — leaves, antlers, or flowers — to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.\\n\\nTenets of the Ancients\\n\\nThe tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of\\n\\nlaw or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.\\n\\nKindle the Light. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.\\n\\nShelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes,\\n\\nstand against the forces that would render it barren.\\n\\nPreserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can’t preserve it in the world.\\n\\nBe the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.\\n\\nOath Spells\\n\\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\\n\\nOath of the Ancients Spells\\n\\nPaladin Level Spells\\n\\n3rd ensnaring strike, speak with animals\\n\\n5th misty step, moonbeam\\n\\n9th plant growth, protection from energy\\n\\n13th ice storm, stoneskin\\n\\n17th commune with nature, tree stride\\n\\nChannel Divinity\\n\\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.\\n\\nNature’s Wrath.

While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines\\n\\nvanish.\\n\\nTurn the Faithless. You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy\\n\\nsymbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1\\n\\nminute or until it takes damage.\\n\\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also\\n\\ncan’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move,\\n\\nthe creature can use the Dodge action.\\n\\nIf the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.\\n\\nAura of Warding\\n\\nBeginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have\\n\\nresistance to damage from spells.\\n\\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\\n\\nUndying Sentinel\\n\\nStarting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this\\n\\nability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.\\n\\nAdditionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can’t be aged magically.\\n\\nElder Champion\\n\\nAt 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take\\n\\non a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or moss-like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.\\n\\nUsing your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:\\n\\nAt the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.\\n\\nWhenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.\\n\\nEnemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.\\n\\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.\\n\\nOath of Vengeance\\n\\nThe Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when\\n\\nan entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside\\n\\n— at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins — sometimes called\\n\\navengers or dark knights — their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.\\n\\nTenets of Vengeance\\n\\nThe tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who\\n\\nuphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or\\n\\nlawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.\\n\\nFight the Greater Evil. Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.\\n\\nNo Mercy for the Wicked. Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.\\n\\nBy Any Means Necessary. My qualms can’t get in the way of exterminating my foes.\\n\\nRestitution. If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.\\n\\nOath Spells\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60\\n\\nfeet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have\\n\\ndisadvantage on this saving throw.\\n\\nOn a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from\\n\\nany bonus to its speed.\\n\\nOn a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.\\n\\nVow of Enmity. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain\\n\\nadvantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.\\n\\nRelentless Avenger\\n\\nBy 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your\\n\\nspeed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.\\n\\nSoul of Vengeance\\n\\nStarting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe.

The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the\\n\\ncreature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

       " \"CH. 3: CLASSES BARD\\n\\nBarbarian\\n\\nA tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his\\n\\npeople’s elk herd.\\n\\nA half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.\\n\\nFrothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.\\n\\nThese barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their\\n\\nanger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.\\n\\nFor some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every\\n\\nbarbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.\\n\\nPrimal Instinct\\n\\nPeople of towns and cities take pride in their settled ways, as if denying one’s connection to nature were a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, a\\n\\nsettled life is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace nature—valuing keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are\\n\\nuncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live\\n\\nand hunt.\\n\\nBarbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A\\n\\nbarbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.\\n\\nA Life of Danger\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival\\n\\ntribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to.\\n\\nTheir courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the\\n\\nrootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them\\n\\nreplaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.\\n\\nCreating a Barbarian\\n\\nWhen creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an\\n\\nappropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a\\n\\nrough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?\\n\\nWhat led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to\\n\\nface a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of\\n\\nwar, brought in chains to another land and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you\\n\\ncommitted, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.\\n\\nQuick Build\\n\\nYou can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second,\\n\\nchoose the outlander background.\\n\\nThe Barbarian\\n\\nLevel Proficiency\\nBonus Features Rages Rage\\n\\nDamage\\n\\n1st +2 Rage, Unarmored Defense 2 +2\\n\\n2nd +2 Reckless Attack, Danger Sense 2 +2\\n\\n3rd +2 Primal Path 3 +2\\n\\n4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 +2\\n\\n5th +3 Extra Attack, Fast Movement 3 +2\\n\\n6th +3 Path Feature 4 +2\\n\\n7th +3 Feral Instinct 4 +2\\n\\n8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 4 +2\\n\\n9th +4 Brutal Critical (1 die) 4 +3\\n\\n10th +4 Path Feature 4 +3\\n\\n11th +4 Relentless Rage 4 +3\\n\\n12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 5 +3\\n\\n13th +5 Brutal Critical (2 dice) 5 +3\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You can use a shield and still gain\\n\\nthis benefit.\\n\\nReckless Attack\\n\\nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can\\n\\ndecide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have\\n\\nadvantage until your next turn.\\n\\nDanger Sense\\n\\nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.\\n\\nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded,\\n\\ndeafened, or incapacitated.\\n\\nPrimal Path\\n\\nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the\\n\\nend of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.\\n\\nAbility Score Improvement\\n\\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability\\n\\nscores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\\n\\nExtra Attack\\n\\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\\n\\nFast Movement\\n\\nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.\\n\\nFeral Instinct\\n\\nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage\\n\\nbefore doing anything else on that turn.\\n\\nBrutal Critical\\n\\nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.\\n\\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.\\n\\nRelentless Rage\\n\\nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds.

Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.\\n\\nPrimal Paths\\n\\nRage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources,\\n\\nhowever. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a\\n\\ntotem animal.\\n\\nPath of the Berserker\\n\\nFor some barbarians, rage is a means to an end — that end being violence.

In battle, your totem spirit\\n\\nfills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.\\n\\nIn some barbarians’ tribes, a totem animal is considered to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one\\n\\ntotem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.\\n\\nSpirit Seeker\\n\\nYours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to\\n\\ncast the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals, as described in chapter 10, “Spellcasting.”\\n\\nTotem Spirit\\n\\nAt 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object — an amulet or\\n\\nsimilar adornment — that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes\\n\\nthat are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the\\n\\neagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.\\n\\nYour totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or\\n\\nvulture in place of an eagle.\\n\\nBear. While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any\\n\\npunishment.\\n\\nEagle. While you’re raging, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action\\n\\non your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.\\n\\nWolf. While you’re raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the\\n\\nwolf makes you a leader of hunters.\\n\\nAspect of the Beast\\n\\nAt 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different\\n\\none.\\n\\nBear. You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength\\n\\nchecks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.\\n\\nEagle. You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something\\n\\nno more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.\\n\\nWolf. You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at\\n\\na normal pace (see chapter 8, “Adventuring,” for rules on travel pace).\\n\\nSpirit Walker\\n\\nAt 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for\\n\\nTotem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.\\n\\nTotemic Attunement\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

       " \"ROGUE WARLOCK\\n\\nSorcerer\\n\\nGolden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery\\n\\nwings spread from her back and she takes to the air.\\n\\nLong hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic\\n\\nsurges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.\\n\\nCrouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks\\n\\nback behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.\\n\\nSorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One\\n\\ncan’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the\\n\\nsorcerer.\\n\\nRaw Magic\\n\\nMagic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs\\n\\nfrom an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in\\n\\nunexpected ways.\\n\\nThe appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines\\n\\nof descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their\\n\\npower, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from\\n\\na mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the\\n\\nmaddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.\\n\\nSorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as\\n\\nwarlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

People with magical power\\n\\nseething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in\\n\\nunpredictable ways if it isn’t called on.\\n\\nSorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses\\n\\nthem, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are\\n\\nevery bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in\\n\\nusing the spells they know.\\n\\nCreating a Sorcerer\\n\\nThe most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you’ll choose an origin that ties\\n\\nto a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you\\n\\nfrom distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?\\n\\nHow do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a\\n\\ncurse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you\\n\\nfeel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you\\n\\nwant from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world — the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the\\n\\ndragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.\\n\\nQuick Build\\n\\nYou can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions.

This font of magic, whatever its\\n\\norigin, fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.\\n\\nCantrips\\n\\nAt 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as\\n\\nshown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.\\n\\nSpell Slots\\n\\nThe Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must\\n\\nexpend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\\n\\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either\\n\\nslot.\\n\\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\\n\\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.\\n\\nThe Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for\\n\\nwhich you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\\n\\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer\\n\\nspell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\\n\\nSpellcasting Ability\\n\\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use\\n\\nyour Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a\\n\\nsorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\\n\\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\\n\\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\\n\\nSpellcasting Focus\\n\\nYou can use an arcane focus (see chapter 5, “Equip ment”) as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.\\n\\nSorcerous Origin\\n\\nChoose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the\\n\\nclass description.\\n\\nYour choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.\\n\\nFont of Magic\\n\\nAt 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of\\n\\nmagical effects.\\n\\nSorcery Points\\n\\nYou have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have\\n\\nmore sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.\\n\\nFlexible Casting\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table\\n\\nshows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level.

You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another\\n\\none at 10th and 17th level.\\n\\nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.\\n\\nCareful Spell\\n\\nWhen you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so,\\n\\nyou spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature\\n\\nautomatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.\\n\\nDistant Spell\\n\\nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.\\n\\nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.\\n\\nEmpowered Spell\\n\\nWhen you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).\\n\\nYou must use the new rolls.\\n\\nYou can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.\\n\\nExtended Spell\\n\\nWhen you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.\\n\\nHeightened Spell\\n\\nWhen you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell\\n\\ndisadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.\\n\\nQuickened Spell\\n\\nWhen you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.\\n\\nSubtle Spell\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

For example, magic missile and scorching ray\\n\\naren’t eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.\\n\\nAbility Score Improvement\\n\\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability\\n\\nscores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\\n\\nSorcerous Restoration\\n\\nAt 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.\\n\\nSorcerous Origins\\n\\nDifferent sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic\\n\\nbloodline and wild magic.\\n\\nDraconic Bloodline\\n\\nYour innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace\\n\\ntheir descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of\\n\\nthese bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or\\n\\nsome other exceptional circumstance.\\n\\nDragon Ancestor\\n\\nAt 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.\\n\\nDraconic Ancestry\\n\\nDragon Damage Type\\n\\nBlack Acid\\n\\nBlue Lightning\\n\\nBrass Fire\\n\\nBronze Lightning\\n\\nCopper Acid\\n\\nGold Fire\\n\\nGreen Poison\\n\\nRed Fire\\n\\nSilver Cold\\n\\nWhite Cold\\n\\nYou can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is\\n\\ndoubled if it applies to the check.\\n\\nDraconic Resilience\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and\\n\\nincreases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.\\n\\nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity\\n\\nmodifier.\\n\\nElemental Affinity\\n\\nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to\\n\\none damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.\\n\\nDragon Wings\\n\\nAt 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these\\n\\nwings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.\\n\\nYou can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings\\n\\nmight be destroyed when you manifest them.\\n\\nDraconic Presence\\n\\nBeginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an\\n\\naction, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until\\n\\nyou lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom\\n\\nsaving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is\\n\\nimmune to your aura for 24 hours.\\n\\nWild Magic\\n\\nYour innate magic comes from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a\\n\\nplanar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

However it came to be, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.\\n\\nWild Magic Surge\\n\\nStarting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, the DM can have you roll a d20\\n\\nimmediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If that effect is\\n\\na spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require concentration in this case; the spell lasts\\n\\nfor its full duration.\\n\\nTides of Chaos\\n\\nStarting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do\\n\\nso, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.\\n\\nAny time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of\\n\\n1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.\\n\\nBend Luck\\n\\nStarting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a\\n\\nsaving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the\\n\\ncreature’s roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.\\n\\nControlled Chaos\\n\\nAt 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and\\n\\nuse either number.\\n\\nSpell Bombardment\\n\\nBeginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the\\n\\ndice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.\\n\\nWild Magic Surge\\n\\nd100 Effect\\n\\n01–02 Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.\\n\\n03–04 For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it.\\n\\n05–06 A modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later.\\n\\n07–08 You cast fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on yourself.\\n\\n09–10 You cast magic missile as a 5th-level spell.\\n\\n11–12 Roll a d10. Your height changes by a number of inches equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you shrink. If the roll is even, you grow.\\n\\n13–14 You cast confusion centered on yourself.\\n\\n15–16 For the next minute, you regain 5 hit points at the start of each of your turns.\\n\\n17–18 You grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from your face.\\n\\n19–20 You cast grease centered on yourself.\\n\\n21–22 Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw.\\n\\n23–24 Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue.

If the check succeeds, the\\n\\ntarget realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.\\n\\nWhile a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with\\n\\nthe phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target\\n\\nsurvives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind\\n\\nmight have knocked it off.\\n\\nAn affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature\\n\\ncan attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can\\n\\ndeal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard\\n\\nthat could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.\\n\\nPhantasmal Killer\\n\\n4th-level illusion\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 120 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\\n\\nYou tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature.\\n\\nThe target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target’s turns\\n\\nbefore the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.\\n\\nPhantom Steed\\n\\n3rd-level illusion (ritual)\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 minute\\n\\nRange: 30 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S\\n\\nDuration: 1 hour\\n\\nA Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s appearance,\\n\\nbut it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away\\n\\nfrom the steed.\\n\\nFor the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and\\n\\ncan travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount.

The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power.\\n\\nThat entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a\\n\\nspecific creature’s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway\\n\\n(DM’s choice).\\n\\nWhen the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for\\n\\npayment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on\\n\\nour enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\\n\\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a\\n\\nliving sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per\\n\\nhour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under\\n\\nwhich you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require\\n\\nonly half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\\n\\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to\\n\\nyou, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the creature immediately returns to its home\\n\\nplane.\\n\\nA creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.\\n\\nPlanar Binding\\n\\n5th-level abjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 hour\\n\\nRange: 60 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\\n\\nDuration: 24 hours\\n\\nWith this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the\\n\\nspell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the\\n\\ncompletion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was\\n\\nsummoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.\\n\\nA bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a\\n\\nlocation, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to\\n\\nachieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the\\n\\nsame plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-\\n\\nlevel slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.\\n\\nPlane Shift\\n\\n7th-level conjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You can specify a target destination in\\n\\ngeneral terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or\\n\\nnear that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at\\n\\nthe city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM’s discretion.\\n\\nAlternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation\\n\\ncircle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.\\n\\nYou can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a\\n\\nhit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you\\n\\nspecify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.\\n\\nPlant Growth\\n\\n3rd-level transmutation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action or 8 hours\\n\\nRange: 150 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S\\n\\nDuration: Instantaneous\\n\\nThis spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.\\n\\nIf you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown.\\n\\nA creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.\\n\\nYou can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area from being affected.\\n\\nIf you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The\\n\\nplants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.\\n\\nPoison Spray\\n\\nConjuration cantrip\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 10 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S\\n\\nDuration: Instantaneous\\n\\nYou extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm.

An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the\\n\\neffect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.\\n\\nThe transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to\\n\\nor less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced\\n\\nby the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.\\n\\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it\\n\\ntransformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t\\n\\nreduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.\\n\\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires\\n\\nhands or speech.\\n\\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\\n\\nPower Word Heal\\n\\n9th-level evocation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S\\n\\nDuration: Instantaneous\\n\\nA wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or\\n\\nstunned, the condition ends. If the creature is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\\n\\nPower Word Kill\\n\\n9th-level enchantment\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 60 feet\\n\\nComponents: V\\n\\nDuration: Instantaneous\\n\\nYou utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly.

Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in\\n\\nplace for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot\\n\\nare wasted.\\n\\nThe wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the\\n\\nspell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there,\\n\\nthe creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.\\n\\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a\\n\\ntime through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s\\n\\nproperties as described below.\\n\\nThe wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for\\n\\nthe duration of the spell. Antimagic field has no effect on the wall, and dispel magic can affect only the violet layer.\\n\\n1. Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical\\n\\nranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.\\n\\n2. Orange. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical\\n\\nranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.\\n\\n3. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by\\n\\ndealing at least 60 force damage to it.\\n\\n4. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of\\n\\nequal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.\\n\\n5. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing\\n\\nat least 25 fire damage to it.\\n\\n�. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully\\n\\nsaves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The\\n\\nsuccesses and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\\n\\nWhile this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of\\n\\nequal or higher level.\\n\\n7. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the\\n\\nblindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that\\n\\nis on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)

The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light\\n\\nin a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.\\n\\nYou can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a\\n\\ncreature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.\\n\\nThis spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\\n\\nProgrammed Illusion\\n\\n6th-level illusion\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 120 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)\\n\\nDuration: Until dispelled\\n\\nYou create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion\\n\\nis imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it\\n\\nmakes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.\\n\\nWhen the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes\\n\\nperforming, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.\\n\\nThe triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of\\n\\nthe area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the\\n\\nillusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.\\n\\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image\\n\\ncan determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for\\n\\nwhat it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.\\n\\nProject Image\\n\\n7th-level illusion\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 500 miles\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 gp)\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 day\\n\\nYou create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless\\n\\nof intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.\\n\\nYou can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your\\n\\nmannerisms perfectly.\\n\\nYou can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space.

The spell then ends.\\n\\nResurrection\\n\\n7th-level necromancy\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 hour\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\\n\\nDuration: Instantaneous\\n\\nYou touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn’t die of old age, and that isn’t undead. If its soul is free and willing, the\\n\\ntarget returns to life with all its hit points.\\n\\nThis spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses,\\n\\nand the like; if such effects aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.\\n\\nThis spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.\\n\\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a\\n\\nlong rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.\\n\\nCasting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly.

All creatures and objects that aren’t somehow\\n\\nanchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab\\n\\nonto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.\\n\\nIf some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If\\n\\nan object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.\\n\\nAt the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.\\n\\nRevivify\\n\\n3rd-level necromancy\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes)\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You\\n\\nspecify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of\\n\\nthe town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the\\n\\nduration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.\\n\\nWhen the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only\\n\\nto a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast\\n\\nmakes its way back to where you cast this spell.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.\\n\\nAnimal Shapes\\n\\n8th-level transmutation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 30 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 24 hours\\n\\nYour magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a\\n\\nLarge or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.\\n\\nThe transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A\\n\\ntarget’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma\\n\\nscores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it\\n\\ntransformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t\\n\\nreduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new\\n\\nform, and it can’t speak or cast spells.\\n\\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\\n\\nAnimate Dead\\n\\n3rd-level necromancy\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 minute\\n\\nRange: 10 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)\\n\\nDuration: Instantaneous\\n\\nThis spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a\\n\\nfoul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the\\n\\ncreature’s game statistics).\\n\\nOn each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if\\n\\nyou control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action\\n\\nthe creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If\\n\\nyou issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is\\n\\ncomplete.\\n\\nThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another\\n\\n24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends.

This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the\\n\\nsphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you,\\n\\ncentered on you.\\n\\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to\\n\\ncast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.\\n\\nTargeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no\\n\\neffect on that target.\\n\\nAreas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part\\n\\nof the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap\\n\\nin the wall if the overlap is large enough.\\n\\nSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\\n\\nMagic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a longsword, +1 in the sphere functions as a\\n\\nnonmagical longsword.\\n\\nA magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic\\n\\nweapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the\\n\\nsphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\\n\\nMagical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical\\n\\ntravel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick\\n\\nspell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\\n\\nCreatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly\\n\\nreappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.\\n\\nDispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field\\n\\nspells don’t nullify each other.\\n\\nAntipathy/Sympathy\\n\\n8th-level enchantment\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 hour\\n\\nRange: 60 feet\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no\\n\\nlarger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that\\n\\neither attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.\\n\\nAntipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a\\n\\ncreature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature\\n\\nremains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the\\n\\nnearest safe spot from which it can’t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer\\n\\nfrightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.\\n\\nSympathy. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When\\n\\nsuch a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its\\n\\nturns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can’t willingly move away from the target.\\n\\nIf the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described\\n\\nbelow.\\n\\nEnding the Effect. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw.\\n\\nOn a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a\\n\\ncreature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.\\n\\nA creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.\\n\\nArcane Eye\\n\\n4th-level divination\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 30 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\\n\\nYou create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.\\n\\nYou mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.\\n\\nAs an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another\\n\\nplane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.\\n\\nArcane Gate\\n\\n6th-level conjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 500 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\\n\\nYou create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the duration. Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one point within 10 feet of\\n\\nyou and one point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would open in the space occupied by a\\n\\ncreature, the spell fails, and the casting is lost.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t\\n\\nage.\\n\\nYour astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the\\n\\naddition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to\\n\\nyour material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect\\n\\nspecifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.\\n\\nYour astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return\\n\\nto the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as\\n\\nyou enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor\\n\\ndo they persist when you return to it.\\n\\nThe spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical\\n\\nbody, and it awakens.\\n\\nThe spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell\\n\\nfor that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is\\n\\nintact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.\\n\\nIf you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by\\n\\ndropping to 0 hit points.\\n\\nAugury\\n\\n2nd-level divination (ritual)\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 minute\\n\\nRange: Self\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)\\n\\nDuration: Instantaneous\\n\\nBy casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an\\n\\notherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.

If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the\\n\\nfollowing two effects.\\n\\nYou can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its\\n\\nduration has not expired in the meantime.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or\\n\\nharmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules\\n\\notherwise.\\n\\nChain Lightning\\n\\n6th-level evocation\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer poisoned, but choose one of the diseases below. The\\n\\ntarget is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell’s duration.\\n\\nSince this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it.\\n\\nBlinding Sickness.

You can choose from any of the\\n\\nfollowing effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\\n\\nFlood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over\\n\\nonto dry land.\\n\\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes\\n\\ndown. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25\\n\\npercent chance of capsizing.\\n\\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your\\n\\nnext turn while the flood effect lasts.\\n\\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a\\n\\nwall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the\\n\\nnext round until the normal water level is restored.\\n\\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other\\n\\nunlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain\\n\\nconditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\\n\\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The\\n\\nwhirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet\\n\\nof the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\\n\\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\\n\\ntakes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in\\n\\nthe vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the\\n\\nStrength (Athletics) check to do so.\\n\\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the\\n\\nvortex.\\n\\nControl Weather\\n\\n8th-level transmutation\\n\\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\\n\\nRange: Self (5-mile radius)\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours\\n\\nYou take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don’t have a\\n\\nclear path to the sky ends the spell early.\\n\\nWhen you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the DM based on the climate and season. You can change\\n\\nprecipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions\\n\\nagain. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.\\n\\nWhen you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the\\n\\nwind, you can change its direction.\\n\\nTemperature\\n\\nStage Condition\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your\\n\\ncontrol. (The DM has game statistics for these creatures.)\\n\\nAs a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if\\n\\nyou control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action\\n\\nthe creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If\\n\\nyou issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is\\n\\ncomplete.\\n\\nThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for\\n\\nanother 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to\\n\\nthree creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this spell using\\n\\nan 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot,\\n\\nyou can animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.\\n\\nCreation\\n\\n5th-level illusion\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 minute\\n\\nRange: 30 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of the item you plan to create)\\n\\nDuration: Special\\n\\nYou pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something\\n\\nsimilar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and\\n\\nthe object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.\\n\\nThe duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.\\n\\nMaterial Duration\\n\\nVegetable matter 1 day\\n\\nStone or crystal 12 hours\\n\\nPrecious metals 1 hour\\n\\nGems 10 minutes\\n\\nAdamantine or mithral 1 minute\\n\\nUsing any material created by this spell as another spell’s material component causes that spell to fail.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels.

You give each target you choose a new, illusory\\n\\nappearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.\\n\\nThe spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller\\n\\nand appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs.\\n\\nOtherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.\\n\\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass\\n\\nthrough the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you\\n\\nare, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\\n\\nA creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes\\n\\naware that the target is disguised.\\n\\nSending\\n\\n3rd-level evocation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Unlimited\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)\\n\\nDuration: 1 round\\n\\nYou send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes\\n\\nyou as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to\\n\\nunderstand the meaning of your message.\\n\\nYou can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent\\n\\nchance that the message doesn’t arrive.\\n\\nSequester\\n\\n7th-level transmutation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\\n\\nDuration: Until dispelled\\n\\nBy means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the\\n\\ntarget, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.\\n\\nIf the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older.\\n\\nYou can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target.\\n\\nExamples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The\\n\\ncreature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that\\n\\ncreature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.\\n\\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma\\n\\nscores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency\\n\\nas you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair\\n\\nactions of the new form.\\n\\nYou assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you\\n\\ntransformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage\\n\\ndoesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.\\n\\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing\\n\\nso. You can’t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can\\n\\nnormally speak.\\n\\nWhen you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as\\n\\nnormal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment\\n\\ndoesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your\\n\\nnew form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.\\n\\nDuring this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one\\n\\nexception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.\\n\\nShatter\\n\\n2nd-level evocation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 60 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a chip of mica)\\n\\nDuration: Instantaneous\\n\\nA sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that\\n\\npoint must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The image appears at a spot within\\n\\nrange and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.\\n\\nYou can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its\\n\\nmovements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be\\n\\nwalking.\\n\\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image\\n\\ncan determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

The duplicate is a creature, partially\\n\\nreal and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it\\n\\nhas half the creature’s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates,\\n\\nexcept that it is a construct.\\n\\nThe simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and\\n\\nacting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can\\n\\nit regain expended spell slots.\\n\\nIf the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The\\n\\nsimulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.\\n\\nIf you cast this spell again, any duplicate you created with this spell is instantly destroyed.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather,\\n\\nand other circumstances.\\n\\nYou can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can\\n\\nturn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.\\n\\nPlants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM’s discretion.

So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less\\n\\nthan 5 feet thick.

Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving\\n\\nthrow. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t\\n\\nblinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.\\n\\nA creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.\\n\\nThis spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.\\n\\nSwift Quiver\\n\\n5th-level transmutation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a quiver containing at least one piece of ammunition)\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\\n\\nYou transmute your quiver so it produces an endless supply of nonmagical ammunition, which seems to leap into your hand when you reach for it.\\n\\nOn each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver. Each\\n\\ntime you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition.\\n\\nAny pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.\\n\\nSymbol\\n\\n7th-level abjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 minute\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\\n\\nDuration: Until dispelled or triggered\\n\\nWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be\\n\\nclosed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger\\n\\nthan 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this\\n\\nspell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\\n\\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.\\n\\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the\\n\\nglyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within\\n\\nan object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\\n\\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as\\n\\nheight or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger\\n\\nthe glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\\n\\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light\\n\\nfor 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters\\n\\nthe sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\\n\\nDeath. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore\\n\\nmight consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn’t of legendary\\n\\nimportance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.\\n\\nThe information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell\\n\\nmight yield this information: “Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone,\\n\\nlover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the lips.”\\n\\nLeomund’s Secret Chest\\n\\n4th-level conjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 gp, and a Tiny replica made from\\n\\nthe same materials worth at least 50 gp)\\n\\nDuration: Instantaneous\\n\\nYou hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for\\n\\nthe spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).\\n\\nWhile the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the\\n\\nground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.\\n\\nAfter 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell’s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica\\n\\nchest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.\\n\\nLeomund’s Tiny Hut\\n\\n3rd-level evocation (ritual)\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 minute\\n\\nRange: Self (10-foot-radius hemisphere)\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The only action you can take is\\n\\nto project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids\\n\\nbody.\\n\\nYou can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a protection from evil and good or magic circle\\n\\nspell can’t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target’s body, and the target’s soul\\n\\nbecomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.\\n\\nOnce you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment\\n\\nand your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can’t use any\\n\\nof its class features.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can’t move or take actions at all.\\n\\nWhile possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s\\n\\nsoul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC.\\n\\nOn a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.\\n\\nIf the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body\\n\\nis dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if\\n\\nthe body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.\\n\\nWhen the spell ends, the container is destroyed.\\n\\nMagic Missile\\n\\n1st-level evocation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 120 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S\\n\\nDuration: Instantaneous\\n\\nYou create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage\\n\\nto its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.\\n\\nMagic Mouth\\n\\n2nd-level illusion (ritual)\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 minute\\n\\nRange: 30 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)\\n\\nDuration: Until dispelled\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Choose an object that you can see and that\\n\\nisn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10\\n\\nminutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.\\n\\nWhen that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the\\n\\nobject you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the\\n\\nwords appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and\\n\\nrepeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.\\n\\nThe triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet\\n\\nof the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30\\n\\nfeet of it.\\n\\nMagic Weapon\\n\\n2nd-level transmutation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\\n\\nYou touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell slot of 6th level or\\n\\nhigher, the bonus increases to +3.\\n\\nMajor Image\\n\\n3rd-level illusion\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 120 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\\n\\nYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that\\n\\nyou can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted.\\n\\nYou can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a\\n\\ncreature (like a troglodyte’s stench).\\n\\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes\\n\\nlocation, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it,\\n\\nyou can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it\\n\\ncarry on a conversation, for example.\\n\\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image\\n\\ncan determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for\\n\\nwhat it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.\\n\\nMass Cure Wounds\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell\\n\\nagain.\\n\\nIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any\\n\\nother sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell\\n\\nends.\\n\\nIf you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create\\n\\nsound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.\\n\\nIf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation)\\n\\ncheck against your spell save DC.

One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it\\n\\nhas advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and\\n\\nunaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target’s\\n\\nmemories are modified.\\n\\nWhile this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10\\n\\nminutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its\\n\\nmemory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.\\n\\nYou must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to\\n\\ntake root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the\\n\\ncreature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.\\n\\nA modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment,\\n\\nor beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a\\n\\nbad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.\\n\\nA remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature’s true memory.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target’s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days\\n\\nago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).\\n\\nMoonbeam\\n\\n2nd-level evocation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 120 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\\n\\nA silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the\\n\\ncylinder.\\n\\nWhen a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it\\n\\nmust make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\\n\\nA shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it\\n\\nleaves the spell’s light.\\n\\nOn your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking\\n\\nthe password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal\\n\\nPlane. It ignores illusions.\\n\\nAt the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound’s attack bonus is equal to your\\n\\nspellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.\\n\\nMordenkainen’s Magnificent Mansion\\n\\n7th-level conjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 minute\\n\\nRange: 300 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp)\\n\\nDuration: 24 hours\\n\\nYou conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly\\n\\nand is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the\\n\\nportal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.\\n\\nBeyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.\\n\\nYou can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as\\n\\nyou choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter.\\n\\nYou decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a\\n\\nnormal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch\\n\\nthings, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave it. Furnishings\\n\\nand other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left inside the\\n\\nextradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.\\n\\nMordenkainen’s Private Sanctum\\n\\n4th-level abjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\\n\\nRange: 120 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)\\n\\nDuration: 24 hours\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for\\n\\nthe duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.\\n\\nWhen you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:\\n\\nSound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.\\n\\nThe barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.\\n\\nSensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.\\n\\nCreatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells.\\n\\nNothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.\\n\\nPlanar travel is blocked within the warded area.\\n\\nCasting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase\\n\\nthe size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th.

So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation\\n\\nby up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.\\n\\nAt the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.\\n\\nBecause the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.\\n\\nThis spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the\\n\\nterrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.\\n\\nSimilarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.\\n\\nN Spells\\n\\nNondetection\\n\\n3rd-level abjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25 gp sprinkled over the target, which the spell consumes)\\n\\nDuration: 8 hours\\n\\nFor the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination magic. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet\\n\\nin any dimension. The target can’t be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.\\n\\nNystul’s Magic Aura\\n\\n2nd-level illusion\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a small square of silk)\\n\\nDuration: 24 hours\\n\\nYou place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or\\n\\nan object that isn’t being carried or worn by another creature.\\n\\nWhen you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object\\n\\nevery day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.\\n\\nFalse Aura. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a\\n\\nnonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific\\n\\nschool of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.\\n\\nMask. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense or the trigger of a\\n\\nsymbol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.\\n\\nO Spells\\n\\nOtiluke’s Freezing Sphere\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Each creature\\n\\nwithin the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much\\n\\ndamage.\\n\\nIf the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over\\n\\nan area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature\\n\\ncan use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.\\n\\nYou can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your\\n\\nhand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It\\n\\nshatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the\\n\\nglobe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.\\n\\nOtiluke’s Resilient Sphere\\n\\n4th-level evocation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 30 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic)\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\\n\\nA sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving\\n\\nthrow. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.\\n\\nNothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The\\n\\nsphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside\\n\\nthe sphere damage anything outside it.\\n\\nThe sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the\\n\\nsphere’s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature’s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.\\n\\nA disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.\\n\\nOtto’s Irresistible Dance\\n\\n6th-level enchantment\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 30 feet\\n\\nComponents: V\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!
