       "[\"MONK RANGER\\n\\nPaladin\\n\\nClad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on\\n\\na mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.\\n\\nA dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory.\\n\\nSilently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.\\n\\nSilver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and\\n\\nagain at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.\\n\\nWhatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the\\n\\nwitness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a\\n\\npaladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.\\n\\nThe Cause of Righteousness\\n\\nA paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces\\n\\nof evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power\\n\\nto do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it\\n\\ndoes from a god.\\n\\nPaladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical\\n\\npower they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight\\n\\nfor justice.\\n\\nBeyond the Mundane Life\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin\\n\\nlives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer\\n\\npeople can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight\\n\\nevil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of\\n\\nrighteousness, not to crown and country.\\n\\nAdventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of\\n\\ntreasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.\\n\\nCreating a Paladin\\n\\nThe most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don’t appear until\\n\\nyou reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the\\n\\ngods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything\\n\\nbeautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner\\n\\nsworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists\\n\\nmany deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut,\\n\\nAthena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.\\n\\nHow did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin\\n\\nsense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event — the destruction of your home, perhaps — drive you to your\\n\\nquests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty.\\n\\nOr you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin’s life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that\\n\\npurpose stamped on your soul.\\n\\nAs guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how\\n\\nyour alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and\\n\\nalignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.\\n\\nQuick Build\\n\\nYou can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma.

As an action, you can\\n\\nopen your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you\\n\\nthat is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire\\n\\nCount Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or\\n\\ndesecrated, as with the hallow spell.\\n\\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.\\n\\nLay on Hands\\n\\nYour blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total\\n\\nnumber of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.\\n\\nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount\\n\\nremaining in your pool.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure\\n\\nmultiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.\\n\\nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs.\\n\\nFighting Style\\n\\nAt 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once,\\n\\neven if you later get to choose again.\\n\\nDefense\\n\\nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\\n\\nDueling\\n\\nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.\\n\\nGreat Weapon Fighting\\n\\nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must\\n\\nuse the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.\\n\\nProtection\\n\\nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack\\n\\nroll. You must be wielding a shield.\\n\\nSpellcasting\\n\\nBy 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules\\n\\nof spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.\\n\\nPreparing and Casting Spells\\n\\nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must\\n\\nexpend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\\n\\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin\\n\\nspells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have\\n\\nspell slots.\\n\\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can\\n\\ninclude four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\\n\\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation:\\n\\nat least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\\n\\nSpellcasting Ability\\n\\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma\\n\\nwhenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you\\n\\ncast and when making an attack roll with one.\\n\\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\\n\\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\\n\\nSpellcasting Focus\\n\\nYou can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.\\n\\nDivine Smite\\n\\nStarting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to\\n\\nthe weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage\\n\\nincreases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.\\n\\nDivine Health\\n\\nBy 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.\\n\\nSacred Oath\\n\\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the\\n\\npath but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class\\n\\ndescription.\\n\\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.\\n\\nOath Spells\\n\\nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath\\n\\nspell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\\n\\nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.\\n\\nChannel Divinity\\n\\nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.\\n\\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\\n\\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.\\n\\nAbility Score Improvement\\n\\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability\\n\\nscores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\\n\\nExtra Attack\\n\\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You must be conscious to grant this bonus.\\n\\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\\n\\nAura of Courage\\n\\nStarting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.\\n\\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\\n\\nImproved Divine Smite\\n\\nBy 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with\\n\\na melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.\\n\\nCleansing Touch\\n\\nBeginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.\\n\\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.\\n\\nSacred Oaths\\n\\nBecoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath,\\n\\ntaken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true\\n\\npaladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has\\n\\nalways been true in the paladin’s heart.\\n\\nOath of Devotion\\n\\nThe Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these\\n\\npaladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest\\n\\nstandards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of\\n\\nlaw and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels — the perfect servants of good — as their ideals, and\\n\\nincorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.\\n\\nTenets of Devotion\\n\\nThough the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.\\n\\nHonesty. Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.\\n\\nOath Spells\\n\\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\\n\\nOath of Devotion Spells\\n\\nPaladin Level Spells\\n\\n3rd protection from evil and good, sanctuary\\n\\n5th lesser restoration, zone of truth\\n\\n9th beacon of hope, dispel magic\\n\\n13th freedom of movement, guardian of faith\\n\\n17th commune, flame strike\\n\\nChannel Divinity\\n\\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.\\n\\nSacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your\\n\\nCharisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim\\n\\nlight 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.\\n\\nYou can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect\\n\\nends.\\n\\nTurn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or\\n\\nundead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or\\n\\nuntil it takes damage.\\n\\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also\\n\\ncan’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move,\\n\\nthe creature can use the Dodge action.\\n\\nAura of Devotion\\n\\nStarting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious.\\n\\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\\n\\nPurity of Spirit\\n\\nBeginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell.\\n\\nHoly Nimbus\\n\\nAt 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet\\n\\nbeyond that.\\n\\nWhenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.\\n\\nIn addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.\\n\\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights,\\n\\npaladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving\\n\\nthings of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of\\n\\ngrowing things — leaves, antlers, or flowers — to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.\\n\\nTenets of the Ancients\\n\\nThe tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of\\n\\nlaw or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.\\n\\nKindle the Light. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.\\n\\nShelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes,\\n\\nstand against the forces that would render it barren.\\n\\nPreserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can’t preserve it in the world.\\n\\nBe the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.\\n\\nOath Spells\\n\\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\\n\\nOath of the Ancients Spells\\n\\nPaladin Level Spells\\n\\n3rd ensnaring strike, speak with animals\\n\\n5th misty step, moonbeam\\n\\n9th plant growth, protection from energy\\n\\n13th ice storm, stoneskin\\n\\n17th commune with nature, tree stride\\n\\nChannel Divinity\\n\\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.\\n\\nNature’s Wrath.

While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines\\n\\nvanish.\\n\\nTurn the Faithless. You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy\\n\\nsymbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1\\n\\nminute or until it takes damage.\\n\\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also\\n\\ncan’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move,\\n\\nthe creature can use the Dodge action.\\n\\nIf the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.\\n\\nAura of Warding\\n\\nBeginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have\\n\\nresistance to damage from spells.\\n\\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\\n\\nUndying Sentinel\\n\\nStarting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this\\n\\nability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.\\n\\nAdditionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can’t be aged magically.\\n\\nElder Champion\\n\\nAt 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take\\n\\non a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or moss-like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.\\n\\nUsing your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:\\n\\nAt the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.\\n\\nWhenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.\\n\\nEnemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.\\n\\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.\\n\\nOath of Vengeance\\n\\nThe Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when\\n\\nan entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside\\n\\n— at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins — sometimes called\\n\\navengers or dark knights — their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.\\n\\nTenets of Vengeance\\n\\nThe tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who\\n\\nuphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or\\n\\nlawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.\\n\\nFight the Greater Evil. Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.\\n\\nNo Mercy for the Wicked. Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.\\n\\nBy Any Means Necessary. My qualms can’t get in the way of exterminating my foes.\\n\\nRestitution. If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.\\n\\nOath Spells\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60\\n\\nfeet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have\\n\\ndisadvantage on this saving throw.\\n\\nOn a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from\\n\\nany bonus to its speed.\\n\\nOn a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.\\n\\nVow of Enmity. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain\\n\\nadvantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.\\n\\nRelentless Avenger\\n\\nBy 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your\\n\\nspeed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.\\n\\nSoul of Vengeance\\n\\nStarting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe.

The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the\\n\\ncreature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

The spell ends if the\\n\\ncreature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn’t affected.\\n\\nWhile in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The\\n\\ntarget has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through\\n\\nsmall holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can’t fall and remains hovering\\n\\nin the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.\\n\\nWhile in the form of a misty cloud, the target can’t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or\\n\\notherwise interacted with. The target can’t attack or cast spells.\\n\\nGate\\n\\n9th-level conjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 60 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp)\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\\n\\nYou conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular\\n\\nopening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.\\n\\nThe portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does\\n\\nso is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.\\n\\nDeities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.\\n\\nWhen you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other\\n\\nthan the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on\\n\\nyour side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help\\n\\nyou.\\n\\nGeas\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While\\n\\nthe creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once\\n\\neach day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.\\n\\nYou can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.\\n\\nYou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th\\n\\nlevel, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.\\n\\nGentle Repose\\n\\n2nd-level necromancy (ritual)\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse’s eyes, which must remain there for the duration)\\n\\nDuration: 10 days\\n\\nYou touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead.\\n\\nThe spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against\\n\\nthe time limit of spells such as raise dead.\\n\\nGiant Insect\\n\\n4th-level transmutation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 30 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\\n\\nYou transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A\\n\\ncentipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.\\n\\nEach creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves\\n\\ntheir actions and movement.\\n\\nA creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.\\n\\nThe DM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.\\n\\nGlibness\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that\\n\\nwould determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.\\n\\nGlobe of Invulnerability\\n\\n6th-level abjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Self (10-foot radius)\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\\n\\nAn immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.\\n\\nAny spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot.\\n\\nSuch a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from\\n\\nthe areas affected by such spells.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.\\n\\nGlyph of Warding\\n\\n3rd-level abjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 hour\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)\\n\\nDuration: Until dispelled or triggered\\n\\nWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor\\n\\nor wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger\\n\\nthan 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without\\n\\nbeing triggered.\\n\\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\\n\\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the\\n\\nglyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is\\n\\ninscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the\\n\\nobject, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\\n\\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or\\n\\nweight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t\\n\\ntrigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\\n\\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around\\n\\ncorners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving\\n\\nthrow (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\\n\\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single\\n\\ncreature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell\\n\\nhas a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile\\n\\ncreatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until\\n\\nthe end of its full duration.\\n\\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot\\n\\nlevel above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.\\n\\nGoodberry\\n\\n1st-level transmutation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe)\\n\\nDuration: Instantaneous\\n\\nUp to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration.

Any\\n\\ncreature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area.

Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the DM. Some of these effects\\n\\napply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of\\n\\na specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can\\n\\nmake a Charisma saving throw.

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the\\n\\nspell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it\\n\\ndoesn’t age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target.\\n\\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.\\n\\nBurial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through\\n\\nthe sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.\\n\\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.\\n\\nChaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by\\n\\nany means until then.\\n\\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.\\n\\nHedged Prison. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a\\n\\nlabyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.\\n\\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\\n\\nMinimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the\\n\\ngemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or\\n\\nplanar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.\\n\\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\\n\\nSlumber. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\\n\\nEnding the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target.\\n\\nThe condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to\\n\\npass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based\\n\\non intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.\\n\\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.\\n\\nYou can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the\\n\\nfirst casting is immediately freed from its binding.\\n\\nIncendiary Cloud\\n\\n8th-level conjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

       " \"PALADIN ROGUE\\n\\nRanger\\n\\nRough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a\\n\\nshortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.\\n\\nAfter tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the\\n\\nwave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon’s thick\\n\\nscales.\\n\\nHolding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he\\n\\npoints to the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.\\n\\nFar from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of\\n\\ntrackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.\\n\\nDeadly Hunters\\n\\nWarriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization — humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and\\n\\nmonstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding\\n\\nthemselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.\\n\\nThanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their\\n\\ncombat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the\\n\\nborderlands.\\n\\nIndependent Adventurers\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are\\n\\nindependent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first — and possibly the last — line of defense.\\n\\nThis fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath.\\n\\nFaced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration,\\n\\nand compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against monstrous foes are worth any extra\\n\\nburden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.\\n\\nCreating a Ranger\\n\\nAs you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor,\\n\\nwandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain — perhaps by the same\\n\\nkind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in\\n\\nmystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature\\n\\nthrough the necessity of surviving in the wilds.\\n\\nWhat’s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see\\n\\ntoo much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your\\n\\nwork in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new\\n\\nallies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?\\n\\nQuick Build\\n\\nYou can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions.

Each of these spells must be of a level for which\\n\\nyou have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\\n\\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell\\n\\nlist, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\\n\\nSpellcasting Ability\\n\\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell\\n\\nrefers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when\\n\\nmaking an attack roll with one.\\n\\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\\n\\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\\n\\nRanger Archetype\\n\\nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice\\n\\ngrants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.\\n\\nPrimeval Awareness\\n\\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level\\n\\nof the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in\\n\\nyour favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.\\n\\nAbility Score Improvement\\n\\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability\\n\\nscores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\\n\\nExtra Attack\\n\\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\\n\\nLand’s Stride\\n\\nStarting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without\\n\\nbeing slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.\\n\\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by\\n\\nthe entangle spell.\\n\\nHide in Plain Sight\\n\\nStarting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally\\n\\noccurring materials with which to create your camouflage.\\n\\nOnce you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and\\n\\nwide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take\\n\\nan action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.\\n\\nVanish\\n\\nStarting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to\\n\\nleave a trail.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it\\n\\ndoesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.\\n\\nYou are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or\\n\\ndeafened.\\n\\nFoe Slayer\\n\\nAt 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the\\n\\ndamage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects\\n\\nof the roll are applied.\\n\\nRanger Archetypes\\n\\nThe ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the Beast Master.\\n\\nHunter\\n\\nEmulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between the people you protect and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk\\n\\nthe Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres to towering giants and terrifying dragons.\\n\\nHunter’s Prey\\n\\nAt 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\\n\\nColossus Slayer. Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8\\n\\ndamage if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.\\n\\nGiant Killer. When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature\\n\\nimmediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.\\n\\nHorde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different\\n\\ncreature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.\\n\\nDefensive Tactics\\n\\nAt 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\\n\\nEscape the Horde. Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.\\n\\nMultiattack Defense. When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest\\n\\nof the turn.\\n\\nSteel Will.

When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw\\n\\nto take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\\n\\nStand Against the Tide. When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same\\n\\nattack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.\\n\\nUncanny Dodge. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.\\n\\nBeast Master\\n\\nThe Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the wild.

Choose a beast that is no larger\\n\\nthan Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (appendix D presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff, and panther as examples). Add your\\n\\nproficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum\\n\\nequals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest\\n\\nto regain hit points.\\n\\nThe beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no\\n\\naction required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. If you don’t issue a command,\\n\\nthe beast takes the Dodge action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to\\n\\ntake the Attack action.\\n\\nIf you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your command to use its\\n\\nreaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.\\n\\nWhile traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.\\n\\nIf the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours magically bonding with a beast that isn’t hostile to you and that meets the\\n\\nrequirements.\\n\\nExceptional Training\\n\\nBeginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when your beast companion doesn’t attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the\\n\\nDash, Disengage, or Help action on its turn.\\n\\nIn addition, the beast’s attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\\n\\nBestial Fury\\n\\nStarting at 11th level, when you command your beast companion to take the Attack action, the beast can make two attacks, or it can take the Multiattack\\n\\naction if it has that action.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

       " \"ROGUE WARLOCK\\n\\nSorcerer\\n\\nGolden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery\\n\\nwings spread from her back and she takes to the air.\\n\\nLong hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic\\n\\nsurges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.\\n\\nCrouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks\\n\\nback behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.\\n\\nSorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One\\n\\ncan’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the\\n\\nsorcerer.\\n\\nRaw Magic\\n\\nMagic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs\\n\\nfrom an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in\\n\\nunexpected ways.\\n\\nThe appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines\\n\\nof descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their\\n\\npower, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from\\n\\na mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the\\n\\nmaddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.\\n\\nSorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as\\n\\nwarlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

People with magical power\\n\\nseething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in\\n\\nunpredictable ways if it isn’t called on.\\n\\nSorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses\\n\\nthem, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are\\n\\nevery bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in\\n\\nusing the spells they know.\\n\\nCreating a Sorcerer\\n\\nThe most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you’ll choose an origin that ties\\n\\nto a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you\\n\\nfrom distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?\\n\\nHow do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a\\n\\ncurse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you\\n\\nfeel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you\\n\\nwant from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world — the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the\\n\\ndragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.\\n\\nQuick Build\\n\\nYou can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second,\\n\\nchoose the hermit background. Third, choose the light, prestidigitation, ray of frost, and shocking grasp cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells shield and\\n\\nmagic missile.\\n\\nThe Sorcerer\\n\\n\\xa0 — Spell Slots per Spell Level —\\n\\nLevel Proficiency\\nBonus\\n\\nSorcery\\nPoints Features Cantrips\\n\\nKnown\\nSpells\\nKnown 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th\\n\\n1st +2 — Spellcasting, Sorcerous Origin 4 2 2 — — — — — — — —\\n\\n2nd +2 2 Font of Magic 4 3 3 — — — — — — — —\\n\\n3rd +2 3 Metamagic 4 4 4 2 — — — — — — —\\n\\n4th +2 4 Ability Score Improvement 5 5 4 3 — — — — — — —\\n\\n5th +3 5 — 5 6 4 3 2 — — — — — —\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as\\n\\nshown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.\\n\\nSpell Slots\\n\\nThe Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must\\n\\nexpend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\\n\\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either\\n\\nslot.\\n\\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\\n\\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.\\n\\nThe Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for\\n\\nwhich you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\\n\\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer\\n\\nspell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\\n\\nSpellcasting Ability\\n\\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use\\n\\nyour Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a\\n\\nsorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\\n\\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\\n\\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\\n\\nSpellcasting Focus\\n\\nYou can use an arcane focus (see chapter 5, “Equip ment”) as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.\\n\\nSorcerous Origin\\n\\nChoose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the\\n\\nclass description.\\n\\nYour choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.\\n\\nFont of Magic\\n\\nAt 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of\\n\\nmagical effects.\\n\\nSorcery Points\\n\\nYou have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have\\n\\nmore sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.\\n\\nFlexible Casting\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

For example, magic missile and scorching ray\\n\\naren’t eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.\\n\\nAbility Score Improvement\\n\\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability\\n\\nscores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\\n\\nSorcerous Restoration\\n\\nAt 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.\\n\\nSorcerous Origins\\n\\nDifferent sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic\\n\\nbloodline and wild magic.\\n\\nDraconic Bloodline\\n\\nYour innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace\\n\\ntheir descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of\\n\\nthese bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or\\n\\nsome other exceptional circumstance.\\n\\nDragon Ancestor\\n\\nAt 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.\\n\\nDraconic Ancestry\\n\\nDragon Damage Type\\n\\nBlack Acid\\n\\nBlue Lightning\\n\\nBrass Fire\\n\\nBronze Lightning\\n\\nCopper Acid\\n\\nGold Fire\\n\\nGreen Poison\\n\\nRed Fire\\n\\nSilver Cold\\n\\nWhite Cold\\n\\nYou can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is\\n\\ndoubled if it applies to the check.\\n\\nDraconic Resilience\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and\\n\\nincreases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.\\n\\nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity\\n\\nmodifier.\\n\\nElemental Affinity\\n\\nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to\\n\\none damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.\\n\\nDragon Wings\\n\\nAt 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these\\n\\nwings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.\\n\\nYou can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings\\n\\nmight be destroyed when you manifest them.\\n\\nDraconic Presence\\n\\nBeginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an\\n\\naction, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until\\n\\nyou lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom\\n\\nsaving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is\\n\\nimmune to your aura for 24 hours.\\n\\nWild Magic\\n\\nYour innate magic comes from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a\\n\\nplanar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

However it came to be, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.\\n\\nWild Magic Surge\\n\\nStarting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, the DM can have you roll a d20\\n\\nimmediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If that effect is\\n\\na spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require concentration in this case; the spell lasts\\n\\nfor its full duration.\\n\\nTides of Chaos\\n\\nStarting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do\\n\\nso, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.\\n\\nAny time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of\\n\\n1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.\\n\\nBend Luck\\n\\nStarting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a\\n\\nsaving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the\\n\\ncreature’s roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.\\n\\nControlled Chaos\\n\\nAt 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and\\n\\nuse either number.\\n\\nSpell Bombardment\\n\\nBeginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the\\n\\ndice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.\\n\\nWild Magic Surge\\n\\nd100 Effect\\n\\n01–02 Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.\\n\\n03–04 For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it.\\n\\n05–06 A modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later.\\n\\n07–08 You cast fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on yourself.\\n\\n09–10 You cast magic missile as a 5th-level spell.\\n\\n11–12 Roll a d10. Your height changes by a number of inches equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you shrink. If the roll is even, you grow.\\n\\n13–14 You cast confusion centered on yourself.\\n\\n15–16 For the next minute, you regain 5 hit points at the start of each of your turns.\\n\\n17–18 You grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from your face.\\n\\n19–20 You cast grease centered on yourself.\\n\\n21–22 Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw.\\n\\n23–24 Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue.

       " \"CH. 3: CLASSES BARD\\n\\nBarbarian\\n\\nA tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his\\n\\npeople’s elk herd.\\n\\nA half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.\\n\\nFrothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.\\n\\nThese barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their\\n\\nanger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.\\n\\nFor some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every\\n\\nbarbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.\\n\\nPrimal Instinct\\n\\nPeople of towns and cities take pride in their settled ways, as if denying one’s connection to nature were a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, a\\n\\nsettled life is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace nature—valuing keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are\\n\\nuncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live\\n\\nand hunt.\\n\\nBarbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A\\n\\nbarbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.\\n\\nA Life of Danger\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival\\n\\ntribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to.\\n\\nTheir courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the\\n\\nrootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them\\n\\nreplaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.\\n\\nCreating a Barbarian\\n\\nWhen creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an\\n\\nappropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a\\n\\nrough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?\\n\\nWhat led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to\\n\\nface a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of\\n\\nwar, brought in chains to another land and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you\\n\\ncommitted, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.\\n\\nQuick Build\\n\\nYou can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second,\\n\\nchoose the outlander background.\\n\\nThe Barbarian\\n\\nLevel Proficiency\\nBonus Features Rages Rage\\n\\nDamage\\n\\n1st +2 Rage, Unarmored Defense 2 +2\\n\\n2nd +2 Reckless Attack, Danger Sense 2 +2\\n\\n3rd +2 Primal Path 3 +2\\n\\n4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 +2\\n\\n5th +3 Extra Attack, Fast Movement 3 +2\\n\\n6th +3 Path Feature 4 +2\\n\\n7th +3 Feral Instinct 4 +2\\n\\n8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 4 +2\\n\\n9th +4 Brutal Critical (1 die) 4 +3\\n\\n10th +4 Path Feature 4 +3\\n\\n11th +4 Relentless Rage 4 +3\\n\\n12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 5 +3\\n\\n13th +5 Brutal Critical (2 dice) 5 +3\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You can use a shield and still gain\\n\\nthis benefit.\\n\\nReckless Attack\\n\\nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can\\n\\ndecide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have\\n\\nadvantage until your next turn.\\n\\nDanger Sense\\n\\nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.\\n\\nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded,\\n\\ndeafened, or incapacitated.\\n\\nPrimal Path\\n\\nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the\\n\\nend of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.\\n\\nAbility Score Improvement\\n\\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability\\n\\nscores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\\n\\nExtra Attack\\n\\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\\n\\nFast Movement\\n\\nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.\\n\\nFeral Instinct\\n\\nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage\\n\\nbefore doing anything else on that turn.\\n\\nBrutal Critical\\n\\nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.\\n\\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.\\n\\nRelentless Rage\\n\\nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you\\n\\ncan make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.\\n\\nPrimal Paths\\n\\nRage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources,\\n\\nhowever. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a\\n\\ntotem animal.\\n\\nPath of the Berserker\\n\\nFor some barbarians, rage is a means to an end — that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As\\n\\nyou enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.\\n\\nFrenzy\\n\\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single\\n\\nmelee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in\\n\\nappendix A).\\n\\nMindless Rage\\n\\nBeginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended\\n\\nfor the duration of the rage.\\n\\nIntimidating Presence\\n\\nBeginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see\\n\\nwithin 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your\\n\\nCharisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

In battle, your totem spirit\\n\\nfills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.\\n\\nIn some barbarians’ tribes, a totem animal is considered to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one\\n\\ntotem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.\\n\\nSpirit Seeker\\n\\nYours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to\\n\\ncast the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals, as described in chapter 10, “Spellcasting.”\\n\\nTotem Spirit\\n\\nAt 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object — an amulet or\\n\\nsimilar adornment — that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes\\n\\nthat are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the\\n\\neagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.\\n\\nYour totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or\\n\\nvulture in place of an eagle.\\n\\nBear. While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any\\n\\npunishment.\\n\\nEagle. While you’re raging, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action\\n\\non your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.\\n\\nWolf. While you’re raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the\\n\\nwolf makes you a leader of hunters.\\n\\nAspect of the Beast\\n\\nAt 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different\\n\\none.\\n\\nBear. You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength\\n\\nchecks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.\\n\\nEagle. You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something\\n\\nno more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.\\n\\nWolf. You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at\\n\\na normal pace (see chapter 8, “Adventuring,” for rules on travel pace).\\n\\nSpirit Walker\\n\\nAt 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for\\n\\nTotem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.\\n\\nTotemic Attunement\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You give each target you choose a new, illusory\\n\\nappearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.\\n\\nThe spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller\\n\\nand appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs.\\n\\nOtherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.\\n\\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass\\n\\nthrough the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you\\n\\nare, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\\n\\nA creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes\\n\\naware that the target is disguised.\\n\\nSending\\n\\n3rd-level evocation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Unlimited\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)\\n\\nDuration: 1 round\\n\\nYou send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes\\n\\nyou as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to\\n\\nunderstand the meaning of your message.\\n\\nYou can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent\\n\\nchance that the message doesn’t arrive.\\n\\nSequester\\n\\n7th-level transmutation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\\n\\nDuration: Until dispelled\\n\\nBy means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the\\n\\ntarget, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.\\n\\nIf the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older.\\n\\nYou can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target.\\n\\nExamples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The\\n\\ncreature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that\\n\\ncreature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.\\n\\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma\\n\\nscores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency\\n\\nas you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair\\n\\nactions of the new form.\\n\\nYou assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you\\n\\ntransformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage\\n\\ndoesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.\\n\\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing\\n\\nso. You can’t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can\\n\\nnormally speak.\\n\\nWhen you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as\\n\\nnormal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment\\n\\ndoesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your\\n\\nnew form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.\\n\\nDuring this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one\\n\\nexception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.\\n\\nShatter\\n\\n2nd-level evocation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 action\\n\\nRange: 60 feet\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a chip of mica)\\n\\nDuration: Instantaneous\\n\\nA sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that\\n\\npoint must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The image appears at a spot within\\n\\nrange and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.\\n\\nYou can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its\\n\\nmovements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be\\n\\nwalking.\\n\\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image\\n\\ncan determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

The duplicate is a creature, partially\\n\\nreal and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it\\n\\nhas half the creature’s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates,\\n\\nexcept that it is a construct.\\n\\nThe simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and\\n\\nacting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can\\n\\nit regain expended spell slots.\\n\\nIf the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The\\n\\nsimulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.\\n\\nIf you cast this spell again, any duplicate you created with this spell is instantly destroyed.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather,\\n\\nand other circumstances.\\n\\nYou can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can\\n\\nturn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.\\n\\nPlants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM’s discretion.

So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less\\n\\nthan 5 feet thick.

Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving\\n\\nthrow. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t\\n\\nblinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.\\n\\nA creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.\\n\\nThis spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.\\n\\nSwift Quiver\\n\\n5th-level transmutation\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (a quiver containing at least one piece of ammunition)\\n\\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\\n\\nYou transmute your quiver so it produces an endless supply of nonmagical ammunition, which seems to leap into your hand when you reach for it.\\n\\nOn each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver. Each\\n\\ntime you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition.\\n\\nAny pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.\\n\\nSymbol\\n\\n7th-level abjuration\\n\\nCasting Time: 1 minute\\n\\nRange: Touch\\n\\nComponents: V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\\n\\nDuration: Until dispelled or triggered\\n\\nWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be\\n\\nclosed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger\\n\\nthan 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this\\n\\nspell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\\n\\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.\\n\\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the\\n\\nglyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within\\n\\nan object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\\n\\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as\\n\\nheight or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger\\n\\nthe glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\\n\\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light\\n\\nfor 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters\\n\\nthe sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\\n\\nDeath. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The rules\\n\\nfor determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they\\'re moving over.\\n\\nSpeed\\n\\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short\\n\\nbursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.\\n\\nThe following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\\n\\nTravel Pace\\n\\nWhile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can\\n\\nmove in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak\\n\\naround and to search an area more carefully (see the “Activity While Traveling” section later in this chapter for more information).\\n\\nForced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\\n\\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must\\n\\nmake a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one\\n\\nlevel of exhaustion (see Appendix A).\\n\\nMounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop\\n\\nfor about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger\\n\\ndistances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\\n\\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel\\n\\n(see chapter 5, “Equipment”), and they don\\'t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the\\n\\ncrew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\\n\\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly. The Dungeon\\n\\nMaster’s Guide contains more information on special methods of travel.\\n\\nTravel Pace\\n\\nDistance Traveled Per...\\n\\nPace Minute Hour Day Effect\\n\\nFast 400 feet 4 miles 30 miles -5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores\\n\\nNormal 300 feet 3 miles 24 miles -\\n\\nSlow 200 feet 2 miles 18 miles Able to use stealth\\n\\nDifficult Terrain\\n\\nThe travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often\\n\\nface dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground — all considered difficult terrain.\\n\\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain — moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed — so you can cover only half the normal distance in a\\n\\nminute, an hour, or a day.\\n\\nSpecial Types of Movement\\n\\nMovement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or\\n\\njump to get where they need to go.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You ignore this extra cost if you\\n\\nhave a climbing speed and use it to climb, or a swimming speed and use it to swim. At the DM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few\\n\\nhandholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics)\\n\\ncheck.\\n\\nJumping\\n\\nYour Strength determines how far you can jump.\\n\\nLong Jump. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the\\n\\njump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.\\n\\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn\\'t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM\\'s option, you must succeed on a DC\\n\\n10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump\\'s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.\\n\\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.\\n\\nHigh Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least\\n\\n10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear\\n\\non the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you\\n\\nnormally can.\\n\\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1\\n\\n1/2 times your height.\\n\\nActivity While Traveling\\n\\nAs adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help\\n\\nthe group’s journey.\\n\\nMarching Order\\n\\nThe adventurers should establish a marching order. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can\\n\\nspot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.\\n\\nA character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel\\n\\nside by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.\\n\\nFewer Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one\\n\\nrank, it’s considered a front rank.\\n\\nStealth\\n\\nWhile traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As long as they’re not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures\\n\\nthey encounter.

The DM might decide\\n\\nthat a threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, the DM might decide\\n\\nthat only those characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while characters in the front and middle\\n\\nranks cannot.\\n\\nWhile traveling at a fast pace, characters take a –5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to notice hidden threats.\\n\\nEncountering Creatures. If the DM determines that the adventurers encounter other creatures while they’re traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what\\n\\nhappens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.\\n\\nSurprising Foes. If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised\\n\\nwhen combat erupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.\\n\\nOther Activities\\n\\nCharacters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don’t contribute their\\n\\npassive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing hidden threats. However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the\\n\\nfollowing activities instead, or some other activity with the DM’s permission.\\n\\nNavigate. The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon\\n\\nMaster’s Guide has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)\\n\\nDraw a Map. The character can draw a map that records the group’s progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check\\n\\nis required.\\n\\nTrack. A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide\\n\\nhas rules for tracking.)\\n\\nForage. The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon\\n\\nMaster’s Guide has rules for foraging.)\\n\\nThe Environment\\n\\nBy its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some\\n\\nof the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places. The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules covering more\\n\\nunusual situations.\\n\\nFalling\\n\\nA fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer.\\n\\nAt the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids\\n\\ntaking damage from the fall.\\n\\nSuffocating\\n\\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\\n\\nWhen a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start\\n\\nof its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can\\'t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\\n\\nFor example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0\\n\\nhit points.\\n\\nVision and Light\\n\\nThe most fundamental tasks of adventuring — noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a\\n\\nfew — rely heavily on a character\\'s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have\\n\\ndisadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\\n\\nA heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition\\n\\n(see Appendix A) when trying to see something in that area.\\n\\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\\n\\nBright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within\\n\\na specific radius.\\n\\nDim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch,\\n\\nand surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.\\n\\nDarkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon\\n\\nor a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.\\n\\nBlindsight\\n\\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and\\n\\ncreatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.\\n\\nDarkvision\\n\\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision.

The player tells the DM that his or her character is doing\\n\\nsomething, such as moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything, happens.\\n\\nFor example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a\\n\\nnearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call for a Strength check to see\\n\\nwhether the character can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.\\n\\nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be\\n\\naffected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The DM determines an object\\'s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that\\n\\ncertain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It\\'s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and\\n\\nDexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.\\n\\nA character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The DM sets the DC for any such check.\\n\\nSocial Interaction\\n\\nExploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less important, though, are the social interactions\\n\\nthat adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.\\n\\nInteraction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon\\n\\nso that it will spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any characters who are participating in the interaction that don’t belong to another player at the\\n\\ntable. Any such character is called a nonplayer character (NPC).\\n\\nIn general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones\\n\\nare inclined to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC, of course.\\n\\nSocial interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.\\n\\nRoleplaying\\n\\nRoleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks.\\n\\nRoleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality\\n\\ninfluence how interactions resolve.\\n\\nThere are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of\\n\\nthe two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.\\n\\nDescriptive Approach to Roleplaying\\n\\nWith this approach, you describe your character’s words and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your character, you\\n\\ntell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.\\n\\nFor instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick temper and blames the elves of the Cloakwood for his family’s misfortune. At a tavern, an\\n\\nobnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to strike up a conversation with the dwarf.\\n\\nChris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering\\n\\nanother drink.”\\n\\nIn this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s mood and given the DM a clear idea of his character’s attitude and actions.\\n\\nWhen using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:\\n\\nDescribe your character’s emotions and attitude.\\n\\nFocus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive it.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing what you see in your mind.\\n\\nActive Approach to Roleplaying\\n\\nIf descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them.\\n\\nWhen you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your character’s movements\\n\\nand body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe things that can’t be reasonably acted\\n\\nout.\\n\\nGoing back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris used active roleplaying:\\n\\nSpeaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, “I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I’d\\n\\nsnap your arm and enjoy your screams.” In his normal voice, Chris then adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.”\\n\\nResults of Roleplaying\\n\\nThe DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf\\n\\nrefuses to let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.\\n\\nWhen interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and personality. You might be able to determine an\\n\\nNPC’s personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence the NPC’s attitude.\\n\\nInteractions in D&D are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten them with something they fear, or play on\\n\\ntheir sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble’s\\n\\nallies, your efforts to convince or deceive will fall short.\\n\\nAbility Checks\\n\\nIn addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.\\n\\nYour roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, your DM can call for a\\n\\nCharisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play a role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other checks might be\\n\\nappropriate in certain situations, at your DM’s discretion.\\n\\nPay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that\\n\\nrelies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is proficient in Deception is the best\\n\\nbet to lead the discussion. When negotiating for a hostage’s release, the cleric with Persuasion should do most of the talking.\\n\\nResting\\n\\nHeroic though they might be, adventurers can\\'t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest —\\n\\ntime to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.\\n\\nAdventurers, as well as other creatures, can take short rests in the midst of a day and a long rest to end it.\\n\\nShort Rest\\n\\nA short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending\\n\\nto wounds.\\n\\nA character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s\\n\\nlevel. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal\\n\\nto the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a\\n\\nlong rest, as explained below.\\n\\nLong Rest\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity — at least 1 hour of\\n\\nwalking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity — the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.\\n\\nAt the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the\\n\\ncharacter\\'s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon\\n\\nfinishing a long rest.\\n\\nA character can\\'t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its\\n\\nbenefits.\\n\\nBetween Adventures\\n\\nBetween trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many\\n\\nadventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.\\n\\nIn some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the DM might simply\\n\\ndeclare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the DM\\n\\nmight want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.\\n\\nLifestyle Expenses\\n\\nBetween adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in chapter 5.\\n\\nLiving a particular lifestyle doesn\\'t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For\\n\\nexample, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.\\n\\nDowntime Activities\\n\\nBetween adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each\\n\\ndowntime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the\\n\\ndowntime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can\\n\\nkeep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\\n\\nDowntime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not\\n\\ncovered here, discuss it with your DM.\\n\\nCrafting\\n\\nYou can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying\\n\\nto create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient\\n\\nwith smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\\n\\nFor every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw\\n\\nmaterials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp\\n\\nincrements until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.\\n\\nMultiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools\\n\\nand are working together in the same place.

The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the\\n\\nfight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.\\n\\nSurprise\\n\\nA band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage,\\n\\nunnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.\\n\\nThe DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the\\n\\nDexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster\\n\\nthat doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.\\n\\nIf you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a\\n\\ngroup can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.\\n\\nInitiative\\n\\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the\\n\\ninitiative order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.\\n\\nThe DM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative\\n\\norder) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.\\n\\nIf a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM can\\n\\ndecide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to\\n\\ndetermine the order, highest roll going first.\\n\\nYour Turn\\n\\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed —\\n\\nsometimes called your walking speed — is noted on your character sheet.\\n\\nThe most common actions you can take are described in the \"Actions in Combat\" section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities\\n\\nprovide additional options for your action.\\n\\nThe \"Movement and Position\" section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.\\n\\nYou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or\\n\\nReady action, as described in \"Actions in Combat.\"\\n\\nBonus Actions\\n\\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for\\n\\nexample, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you\\n\\ncan do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.\\n\\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

For example, you could open a door\\n\\nduring your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.\\n\\nIf you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as\\n\\nstated in their descriptions.\\n\\nThe DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the\\n\\nDM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\\n\\nReactions\\n\\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some\\n\\nkind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.\\n\\nWhen you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can\\n\\ncontinue its turn right after the reaction.\\n\\nMovement and Position\\n\\nIn combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.\\n\\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.\\n\\nYour movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute\\n\\nyour entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done\\n\\nmoving.\\n\\nThe “Special Types of Movement” section in chapter 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, and swimming.\\n\\nBreaking Up Your Move\\n\\nYou can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can\\n\\nmove 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.\\n\\nMoving Between Attacks\\n\\nIf you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For\\n\\nexample, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15\\n\\nfeet, and then attack again.\\n\\nUsing Different Speeds\\n\\nIf you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move.\\n\\nWhenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the\\n\\nresult is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.\\n\\nFor example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then\\n\\nleap into the air to fly 30 feet more.\\n\\nDifficult Terrain\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases — the setting of a\\n\\ntypical fight contains difficult terrain.\\n\\nEvery foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.\\n\\nLow furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or\\n\\nnot, also counts as difficult terrain.\\n\\nBeing Prone\\n\\nCombatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they\\n\\nare prone.\\n\\nYou can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For\\n\\nexample, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your\\n\\nspeed is 0.\\n\\nTo move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in\\n\\ndifficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.\\n\\nMoving Around Other Creatures\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

In contrast, you can move through a hostile\\n\\ncreature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that\\n\\nanother creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.\\n\\nWhether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.\\n\\nIf you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained\\n\\nlater in the chapter.\\n\\nFlying Movement\\n\\nFlying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a\\n\\nflying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move,\\n\\nthe creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.\\n\\nCreature Size\\n\\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a\\n\\ncreature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.\\n\\nSize Categories\\n\\nSize Space\\n\\nTiny 2 ½ by 2 ½ ft.\\n\\nSmall 5 by 5 ft.\\n\\nMedium 5 by 5 ft.\\n\\nLarge 10 by 10 ft.\\n\\nHuge 15 by 15 ft.\\n\\nGargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger\\n\\nSpace\\n\\nA creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5\\n\\nfeet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through\\n\\nunless the hobgoblin lets them.\\n\\nA creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another\\n\\ncreature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.\\n\\nBecause larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one,\\n\\nthere’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.\\n\\nSqueezing into a Smaller Space\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage\\n\\nthat’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on\\n\\nattack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.\\n\\nActions in Combat\\n\\nWhen you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an\\n\\naction that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.\\n\\nWhen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if\\n\\nany, to determine success or failure.\\n\\nAttack\\n\\nThe most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.\\n\\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the \"Making an Attack\" section for the rules that govern attacks.\\n\\nCertain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.\\n\\nCast a Spell\\n\\nSpellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a\\n\\ncasting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not\\n\\nnecessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See\\n\\nchapter 10 for the rules on spellcasting.\\n\\nDash\\n\\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed\\n\\nof 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.\\n\\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for\\n\\ninstance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.\\n\\nDisengage\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has\\n\\ndisadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your\\n\\nspeed drops to 0.\\n\\nHelp\\n\\nYou can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next\\n\\nability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make\\n\\nyour ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.\\n\\nHide\\n\\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain\\n\\nbenefits, as described in the \"Unseen Attackers and Targets\" section later in this chapter.\\n\\nReady\\n\\nSometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn,\\n\\nwhich lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.\\n\\nFirst, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you\\n\\nchoose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include \"If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,\" and \"If the goblin\\n\\nsteps next to me, I move away.\"\\n\\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.\\n\\nWhen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must\\n\\nhave a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your concentration is broken, the\\n\\nspell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take\\n\\ndamage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\\n\\nSearch\\n\\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a\\n\\nWisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\\n\\nUse an Object\\n\\nYou normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack.

Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.\\n\\n2. Determine modifiers. The DM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have\\n\\nadvantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects\\n\\ncan apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.\\n\\n3. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack\\n\\nhas rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of\\n\\ndamage.\\n\\nIf there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if\\n\\nyou’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.\\n\\nAttack Rolls\\n\\nWhen you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an\\n\\nattack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or\\n\\nexceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character\\n\\ncreation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.\\n\\nModifiers to the Roll\\n\\nWhen a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a\\n\\nmonster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.\\n\\nAbility Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity.\\n\\nWeapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.\\n\\nSome spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster, as explained in\\n\\nchapter 10.\\n\\nProficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when\\n\\nyou attack with a spell.\\n\\nRolling 1 or 20\\n\\nSometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

This is true\\n\\nwhether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not\\n\\nsee. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just\\n\\nsays that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.\\n\\nWhen a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it.\\n\\nIf you are hidden — both unseen and unheard — when you make an attack, you give away your\\n\\nlocation when the attack hits or misses.\\n\\nRanged Attacks\\n\\nWhen you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might\\n\\nshoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.\\n\\nRange\\n\\nYou can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.\\n\\nIf a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.\\n\\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger\\n\\nnumber is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.\\n\\nRanged Attacks in Close Combat\\n\\nAiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have\\n\\ndisadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.\\n\\nMelee Attacks\\n\\nUsed in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a\\n\\nsword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few\\n\\nspells also involve making a melee attack.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Certain creatures (typically those larger\\n\\nthan Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.\\n\\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of\\n\\nwhich count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed\\n\\nstrikes.\\n\\nOpportunity Attacks\\n\\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.\\n\\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your\\n\\nreaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.\\n\\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when\\n\\nsomeone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion\\n\\nhurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\\n\\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\\n\\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a\\n\\ndifferent light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that\\n\\nmodifier is negative.\\n\\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\\n\\nGrappling\\n\\nWhen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make\\n\\nmultiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\\n\\nThe target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the\\n\\ntarget by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity\\n\\n(Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target\\n\\nto the grappled condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\\n\\nEscaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check\\n\\ncontested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\\n\\nMoving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or\\n\\nmore sizes smaller than you.\\n\\nShoving a Creature\\n\\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make\\n\\nmultiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\\n\\nThe target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics)\\n\\ncheck contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if\\n\\nthe target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.\\n\\nCover\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

A target can benefit from cover only\\n\\nwhen an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.\\n\\nThere are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added\\n\\ntogether. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters\\n\\ncover.\\n\\nHalf Cover\\n\\nA target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The\\n\\nobstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.\\n\\nThree-Quarters Cover\\n\\nA target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is\\n\\ncovered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.\\n\\nTotal Cover\\n\\nA target with total cover can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect.\\n\\nA target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.\\n\\nDamage and Healing\\n\\nInjury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of\\n\\nflame from a fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.\\n\\nHit Points\\n\\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those\\n\\nwith fewer hit points are more fragile.\\n\\nA creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes\\n\\nfrequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\\n\\nWhenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the\\n\\ncreature drops to 0 hit points.\\n\\nDamage Rolls\\n\\nEach weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage\\n\\nto your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.\\n\\nWith a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.\\n\\nWhen attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier — the same modifier used for the attack roll — to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to\\n\\nroll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.\\n\\nIf a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts\\n\\nfireball or a cleric casts flame strike, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.\\n\\nCritical Hits\\n\\nWhen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them\\n\\ntogether. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

If the attack\\n\\ninvolves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.\\n\\nDamage Types\\n\\nDifferent attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules,\\n\\nsuch as damage resistance, rely on the types.\\n\\nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a DM assign a damage type to a new effect.\\n\\nAcid. The corrosive spray of an adult black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.\\n\\nBludgeoning. Blunt force attacks — hammers, falling, constriction, and the like — deal bludgeoning damage.\\n\\nCold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a young white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.\\n\\nFire. Ancient red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.\\n\\nForce. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual\\n\\nweapon.\\n\\nLightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon wyrmling’s breath deal lightning damage.\\n\\nNecrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul.\\n\\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.\\n\\nPoison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of an adult green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.\\n\\nPsychic. Mental abilities such as a psionic blast deal psychic damage.\\n\\nRadiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\\n\\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.\\n\\nThunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\\n\\nDamage Resistance and Vulnerability\\n\\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\\n\\nIf a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage\\n\\ntype, damage of that type is doubled against it.\\n\\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit\\n\\nby an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced\\n\\nby 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\\n\\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to\\n\\nfire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by\\n\\nthree-quarters.\\n\\nHealing\\n\\nUnless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points (as explained\\n\\nin chapter 8), and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.\\n\\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point\\n\\nmaximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14\\n\\ncurrent hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.\\n\\nA creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals\\n\\nor exceeds your hit point maximum.\\n\\nFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but\\n\\n12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\\n\\nFalling Unconscious\\n\\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\\n\\nDeath Saving Throws\\n\\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer\\n\\nto death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and\\n\\nfeatures that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.\\n\\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable\\n\\n(see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The\\n\\nnumber of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\\n\\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\\n\\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you\\n\\nsuffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\\n\\nStabilizing a Creature\\n\\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed\\n\\ndeath saving throw.\\n\\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom\\n\\n(Medicine) check.\\n\\nA stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and\\n\\nmust start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack,\\n\\nthe attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\\n\\nTemporary Hit Points\\n\\nSome spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage,\\n\\na pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\\n\\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit\\n\\npoints. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\\n\\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit\\n\\npoints and receive temporary hit points.\\n\\nHealing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide\\n\\nwhether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can\\n\\nhave 12 or 10, not 22.\\n\\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you\\n\\nwhile you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.\\n\\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.\\n\\nMounted Combat\\n\\nA knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy\\n\\nthe benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.\\n\\nA willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.\\n\\nMounting and Dismounting\\n\\nOnce during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your\\n\\nspeed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet\\n\\nof movement left or if your speed is 0.\\n\\nIf an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in\\n\\na space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.\\n\\nIf your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a\\n\\nspace within 5 feet it.\\n\\nControlling a Mount\\n\\nWhile you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act\\n\\nindependently.\\n\\nYou can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider.

She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.\\n\\nTaking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from\\n\\nhis mouth, engulfing his foes.\\n\\nMoving with the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a\\n\\nstone’s throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the\\n\\ngrip of sleep.\\n\\nWhatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking\\n\\ndisplay of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.\\n\\nThe Magic of Ki\\n\\nMonks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse\\n\\n— specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their\\n\\nbodies’ physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny\\n\\nspeed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their\\n\\nbodies and the bodies of their foes.\\n\\nTraining and Asceticism\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The monks who\\n\\nlive there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their\\n\\nparents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.\\n\\nSome monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to\\n\\nisolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.\\n\\nThe majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other\\n\\ngoods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.\\n\\nFor a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks\\n\\ndon’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and\\n\\nspiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters\\n\\nand plundering their treasure.\\n\\nCreating a Monk\\n\\nAs you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you\\n\\nan orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks?\\n\\nDid you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?\\n\\nConsider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out\\n\\nbecause of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside\\n\\nthe monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?\\n\\nAs a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.\\n\\nQuick Build\\n\\nYou can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the\\n\\nhermit background.\\n\\nThe Monk\\n\\nLevel Proficiency\\nBonus\\n\\nMartial\\nArts\\n\\nKi\\nPoints\\n\\nUnarmored\\nMovement Features\\n\\n1st +2 1d4 — — Unarmored Defense, Martial Arts\\n\\n2nd +2 1d4 2 +10 ft.

This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in\\n\\nthe Martial Arts column of the Monk table.\\n\\nWhen you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For\\n\\nexample, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you\\n\\nhaven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.\\n\\nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short\\n\\nchain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game\\n\\nstatistics provided for the weapon in chapter 5, “Equipment.”\\n\\nKi\\n\\nStarting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your\\n\\nmonk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.\\n\\nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You\\n\\nlearn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.\\n\\nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You\\n\\nmust spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.\\n\\nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\\n\\nKi save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\\n\\nFlurry of Blows\\n\\nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.\\n\\nPatient Defense\\n\\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.\\n\\nStep of the Wind\\n\\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.\\n\\nUnarmored Movement\\n\\nStarting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain\\n\\nmonk levels, as shown in the Monk table.\\n\\nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.\\n\\nMonastic Tradition\\n\\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all\\n\\ndetailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.\\n\\nDeflect Missiles\\n\\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage\\n\\nyou take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.\\n\\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch\\n\\na missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same\\n\\nreaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which\\n\\nhas a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\\n\\nSlow Fall\\n\\nBeginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.\\n\\nExtra Attack\\n\\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\\n\\nStunning Strike\\n\\nStarting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend\\n\\n1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.\\n\\nKi-Empowered Strikes\\n\\nStarting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\\n\\nEvasion\\n\\nAt 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When\\n\\nyou are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on\\n\\nthe saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\\n\\nStillness of Mind\\n\\nStarting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.\\n\\nPurity of Body\\n\\nAt 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.\\n\\nTongue of the Sun and Moon\\n\\nStarting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a\\n\\nlanguage can understand what you say.\\n\\nDiamond Soul\\n\\nBeginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.\\n\\nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.\\n\\nTimeless Body\\n\\nAt 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically.

During that time, you also have resistance to all\\n\\ndamage but force damage.\\n\\nAdditionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other\\n\\ncreatures with you.\\n\\nPerfect Self\\n\\nAt 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.\\n\\nMonastic Traditions\\n\\nThree traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively,\\n\\nbut a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic\\n\\ntechniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.\\n\\nWay of the Open Hand\\n\\nMonks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip\\n\\ntheir opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.\\n\\nOpen Hand Technique\\n\\nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one\\n\\nof the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:\\n\\nIt must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\\n\\nIt must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.\\n\\nIt can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.\\n\\nWholeness of Body\\n\\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest\\n\\nbefore you can use this feature again.\\n\\nTranquility\\n\\nBeginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a\\n\\nsanctuary spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your\\n\\nWisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.\\n\\nQuivering Palm\\n\\nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to\\n\\nstart these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to\\n\\nend them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving\\n\\nthrow. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.\\n\\nYou can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.\\n\\nWay of Shadow\\n\\nMonks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve\\n\\nas spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and\\n\\nmissions. Other monasteries are more like thieves’ guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees.\\n\\nRegardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students.\\n\\nShadow Arts\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to\\n\\ncast darkness, darkvision, pass without trace, or silence, without providing material components. Additionally, you gain the minor illusion cantrip if you\\n\\ndon’t already know it.\\n\\nShadow Step\\n\\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60\\n\\nfeet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end\\n\\nof the turn.\\n\\nCloak of Shadows\\n\\nBy 11th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become\\n\\ninvisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright light.\\n\\nOpportunist\\n\\nAt 17th level, you can exploit a creature’s momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack\\n\\nmade by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.\\n\\nWay of the Four Elements\\n\\nYou follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and\\n\\nbend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but\\n\\nothers weave the elements together.\\n\\nMany monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes,\\n\\nfish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.\\n\\nDisciple of the Elements\\n\\nWhen you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki\\n\\npoints each time you use it.\\n\\nYou know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental discipline of your choice, which are detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines” section\\n\\nbelow. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.\\n\\nWhenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.\\n\\nCasting Elemental Spells. Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these\\n\\nspells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don’t need to provide material components for it.\\n\\nOnce you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that\\n\\nthe spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For\\n\\nexample, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the\\n\\ndiscipline’s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).\\n\\nThe maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to\\n\\nincrease its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.\\n\\nSpells and Ki Points\\n\\nMonk Levels Maximum Ki Points for a Spell\\n\\n5th–8th 3\\n\\n9th–12th 4\\n\\n13th–16th 5\\n\\n17th–20th 6\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You can raise or lower the ice’s\\n\\nelevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. For\\n\\nexample, if you affect a 30-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 15 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 15 feet, dig a trench up to 15\\n\\nfeet deep, and so on.

       " \"RANGER SORCERER\\n\\nRogue\\n\\nSignaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and\\n\\npicks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.\\n\\nA human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target — a notorious slaver — passes the\\n\\nalleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.\\n\\nSuppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt.

They have a knack for finding the solution to just about\\n\\nany problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.\\n\\nSkill and Precision\\n\\nRogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that\\n\\nfew other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such\\n\\nas climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.\\n\\nWhen it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack\\n\\nwill hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a\\n\\nfew learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.\\n\\nA Shady Living\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses,\\n\\nand con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they\\n\\nsometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators,\\n\\nwhich can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats — and wererats — haunt the sewers.\\n\\nAs adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up\\n\\na life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden\\n\\ncrypts in search of treasure.\\n\\nCreating a Rogue\\n\\nAs you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past — or present? Are you on the run from the\\n\\nlaw or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your\\n\\nadventures, or some other desire or ideal?\\n\\nWhat was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe\\n\\nyou were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your\\n\\nhome? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a\\n\\nnew friend — another member of your adventuring party — who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.\\n\\nQuick Build\\n\\nYou can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if\\n\\nyou want to excel at Investigation or plan to take up the Arcane Trickster archetype. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and\\n\\nsocial interaction. Second, choose the charlatan background.\\n\\nThe Rogue\\n\\nLevel Proficiency\\nBonus\\n\\nSneak\\nAttack Features\\n\\n1st +2 1d6 Expertise, Sneak Attack, Thieves’ Cant\\n\\n2nd +2 1d6 Cunning Action\\n\\n3rd +2 2d6 Roguish Archetype\\n\\n4th +2 2d6 Ability Score Improvement\\n\\n5th +3 3d6 Uncanny Dodge\\n\\n6th +3 3d6 Expertise\\n\\n7th +3 4d6 Evasion\\n\\n8th +3 4d6 Ability Score Improvement\\n\\n9th +4 5d6 Roguish Archetype Feature\\n\\n10th +4 5d6 Ability Score Improvement\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you\\n\\nhit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.\\n\\nYou don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have\\n\\ndisadvantage on the attack roll.\\n\\nThe amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.\\n\\nThieves’ Cant\\n\\nDuring your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal\\n\\nconversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it\\n\\ndoes to speak the same idea plainly.\\n\\nIn addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the\\n\\nterritory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.\\n\\nCunning Action\\n\\nStarting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This\\n\\naction can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.\\n\\nRoguish Archetype\\n\\nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of\\n\\nthe class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.\\n\\nAbility Score Improvement\\n\\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two\\n\\nability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\\n\\nUncanny Dodge\\n\\nStarting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.\\n\\nEvasion\\n\\nBeginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are\\n\\nsubjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the\\n\\nsaving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\\n\\nReliable Talent\\n\\nBy 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency\\n\\nbonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.\\n\\nBlindsense\\n\\nStarting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.\\n\\nSlippery Mind\\n\\nBy 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.\\n\\nElusive\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t\\n\\nincapacitated.\\n\\nStroke of Luck\\n\\nAt 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit.\\n\\nAlternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.\\n\\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\\n\\nRoguish Archetypes\\n\\nRogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their\\n\\nincreasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a\\n\\nreflection of your focus — not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.\\n\\nThief\\n\\nYou hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to\\n\\nthink of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills\\n\\nuseful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.\\n\\nFast Hands\\n\\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to\\n\\ndisarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.\\n\\nSecond-Story Work\\n\\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.\\n\\nIn addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.\\n\\nSupreme Sneak\\n\\nStarting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.\\n\\nUse Magic Device\\n\\nBy 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You\\n\\nignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.\\n\\nThief’s Reflexes\\n\\nWhen you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any\\n\\ncombat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are\\n\\nsurprised.\\n\\nAssassin\\n\\nYou focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and even specially\\n\\nanointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadly efficiency.\\n\\nBonus Proficiencies\\n\\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner’s kit.\\n\\nAssassinate\\n\\nStarting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t\\n\\ntaken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and\\n\\naffiliations for an identity. You can’t establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of\\n\\nintroduction, and official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into\\n\\nthe company of other wealthy merchants.\\n\\nThereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.\\n\\nImpostor\\n\\nAt 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person’s speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these\\n\\nthree components of the person’s behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.\\n\\nYour ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check\\n\\nyou make to avoid detection.\\n\\nDeath Strike\\n\\nStarting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving\\n\\nthrow (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.\\n\\nArcane Trickster\\n\\nSome rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. These rogues include\\n\\npickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a significant number of adventurers.\\n\\nSpellcasting\\n\\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells.

The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of\\n\\nthese spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\\n\\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either\\n\\nslot.\\n\\nSpells Known of 1st-Level and Higher. You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and\\n\\nillusion spells on the wizard spell list.\\n\\nThe Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells\\n\\nmust be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in\\n\\nthis class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\\n\\nThe spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.\\n\\nWhenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The\\n\\nnew spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at\\n\\n3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.\\n\\nSpellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.\\n\\nYou use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw\\n\\nDC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\\n\\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\\n\\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\\n\\nMage Hand Legerdemain\\n\\nStarting at 3rd level, when you cast mage hand, you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:\\n\\nYou can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.\\n\\nYou can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.\\n\\nYou can use thieves’ tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.\\n\\nYou can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature’s\\n\\nWisdom (Perception) check.\\n\\nIn addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.\\n\\nMagical Ambush\\n\\nStarting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the\\n\\nspell this turn.\\n\\nVersatile Trickster\\n\\nAt 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your mage hand. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature within 5 feet of the\\n\\nspectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.\\n\\nSpell Thief\\n\\nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.\\n\\nImmediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a\\n\\nsaving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell’s effect against you, and you\\n\\nsteal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn’t need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the\\n\\nspell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can’t cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed.\\n\\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!
