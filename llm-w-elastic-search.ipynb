The DM might use a different time scale\\n\\ndepending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers\\' movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them\\n\\nabout a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the\\n\\nchamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.\\n\\nIn a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those\\n\\nfifteen miles in just under four hours\\' time.\\n\\nFor long journeys, a scale of days works best. Following the road from Baldur\\'s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a\\n\\ngoblin ambush interrupts their journey.\\n\\nIn combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described in chapter 9, “Combat.”\\n\\nMovement\\n\\nSwimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope — all sorts of movement play a key role in\\n\\nfantasy gaming adventures.\\n\\nThe DM can summarize the adventurers\\' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: \"You travel through the forest and find the\\n\\ndungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.\" Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the DM can summarize\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The rules\\n\\nfor determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they\\'re moving over.\\n\\nSpeed\\n\\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short\\n\\nbursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.\\n\\nThe following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\\n\\nTravel Pace\\n\\nWhile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can\\n\\nmove in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak\\n\\naround and to search an area more carefully (see the “Activity While Traveling” section later in this chapter for more information).\\n\\nForced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\\n\\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must\\n\\nmake a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one\\n\\nlevel of exhaustion (see Appendix A).\\n\\nMounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop\\n\\nfor about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger\\n\\ndistances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\\n\\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel\\n\\n(see chapter 5, “Equipment”), and they don\\'t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace.

You ignore this extra cost if you\\n\\nhave a climbing speed and use it to climb, or a swimming speed and use it to swim. At the DM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few\\n\\nhandholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics)\\n\\ncheck.\\n\\nJumping\\n\\nYour Strength determines how far you can jump.\\n\\nLong Jump. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the\\n\\njump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.\\n\\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn\\'t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM\\'s option, you must succeed on a DC\\n\\n10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump\\'s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.\\n\\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.\\n\\nHigh Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least\\n\\n10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear\\n\\non the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you\\n\\nnormally can.\\n\\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1\\n\\n1/2 times your height.\\n\\nActivity While Traveling\\n\\nAs adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help\\n\\nthe group’s journey.\\n\\nMarching Order\\n\\nThe adventurers should establish a marching order. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can\\n\\nspot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.\\n\\nA character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel\\n\\nside by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.\\n\\nFewer Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one\\n\\nrank, it’s considered a front rank.\\n\\nStealth\\n\\nWhile traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As long as they’re not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures\\n\\nthey encounter.

The DM might decide\\n\\nthat a threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, the DM might decide\\n\\nthat only those characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while characters in the front and middle\\n\\nranks cannot.\\n\\nWhile traveling at a fast pace, characters take a –5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to notice hidden threats.\\n\\nEncountering Creatures. If the DM determines that the adventurers encounter other creatures while they’re traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what\\n\\nhappens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.\\n\\nSurprising Foes. If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised\\n\\nwhen combat erupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.\\n\\nOther Activities\\n\\nCharacters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don’t contribute their\\n\\npassive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing hidden threats. However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the\\n\\nfollowing activities instead, or some other activity with the DM’s permission.\\n\\nNavigate. The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon\\n\\nMaster’s Guide has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)\\n\\nDraw a Map. The character can draw a map that records the group’s progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check\\n\\nis required.\\n\\nTrack. A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide\\n\\nhas rules for tracking.)\\n\\nForage. The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon\\n\\nMaster’s Guide has rules for foraging.)\\n\\nThe Environment\\n\\nBy its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some\\n\\nof the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places. The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules covering more\\n\\nunusual situations.\\n\\nFalling\\n\\nA fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer.\\n\\nAt the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids\\n\\ntaking damage from the fall.\\n\\nSuffocating\\n\\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\\n\\nWhen a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start\\n\\nof its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can\\'t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\\n\\nFor example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0\\n\\nhit points.\\n\\nVision and Light\\n\\nThe most fundamental tasks of adventuring — noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a\\n\\nfew — rely heavily on a character\\'s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have\\n\\ndisadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\\n\\nA heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition\\n\\n(see Appendix A) when trying to see something in that area.\\n\\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\\n\\nBright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within\\n\\na specific radius.\\n\\nDim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch,\\n\\nand surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.\\n\\nDarkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon\\n\\nor a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.\\n\\nBlindsight\\n\\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and\\n\\ncreatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.\\n\\nDarkvision\\n\\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision\\n\\ncan see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is\\n\\nconcerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in that darkness, only shades of gray.\\n\\nTruesight\\n\\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual\\n\\nillusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.\\n\\nFurthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The player tells the DM that his or her character is doing\\n\\nsomething, such as moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything, happens.\\n\\nFor example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a\\n\\nnearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call for a Strength check to see\\n\\nwhether the character can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.\\n\\nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be\\n\\naffected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The DM determines an object\\'s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that\\n\\ncertain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It\\'s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and\\n\\nDexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.\\n\\nA character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The DM sets the DC for any such check.\\n\\nSocial Interaction\\n\\nExploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less important, though, are the social interactions\\n\\nthat adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.\\n\\nInteraction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon\\n\\nso that it will spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any characters who are participating in the interaction that don’t belong to another player at the\\n\\ntable. Any such character is called a nonplayer character (NPC).\\n\\nIn general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones\\n\\nare inclined to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC, of course.\\n\\nSocial interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.\\n\\nRoleplaying\\n\\nRoleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks.\\n\\nRoleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality\\n\\ninfluence how interactions resolve.\\n\\nThere are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of\\n\\nthe two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.\\n\\nDescriptive Approach to Roleplaying\\n\\nWith this approach, you describe your character’s words and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your character, you\\n\\ntell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.\\n\\nFor instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick temper and blames the elves of the Cloakwood for his family’s misfortune. At a tavern, an\\n\\nobnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to strike up a conversation with the dwarf.\\n\\nChris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering\\n\\nanother drink.”\\n\\nIn this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s mood and given the DM a clear idea of his character’s attitude and actions.\\n\\nWhen using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:\\n\\nDescribe your character’s emotions and attitude.\\n\\nFocus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive it.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing what you see in your mind.\\n\\nActive Approach to Roleplaying\\n\\nIf descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them.\\n\\nWhen you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your character’s movements\\n\\nand body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe things that can’t be reasonably acted\\n\\nout.\\n\\nGoing back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris used active roleplaying:\\n\\nSpeaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, “I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I’d\\n\\nsnap your arm and enjoy your screams.” In his normal voice, Chris then adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.”\\n\\nResults of Roleplaying\\n\\nThe DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf\\n\\nrefuses to let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.\\n\\nWhen interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and personality. You might be able to determine an\\n\\nNPC’s personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence the NPC’s attitude.\\n\\nInteractions in D&D are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten them with something they fear, or play on\\n\\ntheir sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble’s\\n\\nallies, your efforts to convince or deceive will fall short.\\n\\nAbility Checks\\n\\nIn addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.\\n\\nYour roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, your DM can call for a\\n\\nCharisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play a role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other checks might be\\n\\nappropriate in certain situations, at your DM’s discretion.\\n\\nPay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that\\n\\nrelies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is proficient in Deception is the best\\n\\nbet to lead the discussion. When negotiating for a hostage’s release, the cleric with Persuasion should do most of the talking.\\n\\nResting\\n\\nHeroic though they might be, adventurers can\\'t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest —\\n\\ntime to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.\\n\\nAdventurers, as well as other creatures, can take short rests in the midst of a day and a long rest to end it.\\n\\nShort Rest\\n\\nA short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending\\n\\nto wounds.\\n\\nA character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s\\n\\nlevel. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal\\n\\nto the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a\\n\\nlong rest, as explained below.\\n\\nLong Rest\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity — at least 1 hour of\\n\\nwalking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity — the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.\\n\\nAt the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the\\n\\ncharacter\\'s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon\\n\\nfinishing a long rest.\\n\\nA character can\\'t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its\\n\\nbenefits.\\n\\nBetween Adventures\\n\\nBetween trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many\\n\\nadventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.\\n\\nIn some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the DM might simply\\n\\ndeclare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the DM\\n\\nmight want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.\\n\\nLifestyle Expenses\\n\\nBetween adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in chapter 5.\\n\\nLiving a particular lifestyle doesn\\'t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For\\n\\nexample, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.\\n\\nDowntime Activities\\n\\nBetween adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each\\n\\ndowntime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the\\n\\ndowntime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can\\n\\nkeep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\\n\\nDowntime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not\\n\\ncovered here, discuss it with your DM.\\n\\nCrafting\\n\\nYou can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying\\n\\nto create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient\\n\\nwith smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\\n\\nFor every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw\\n\\nmaterials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp\\n\\nincrements until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.\\n\\nMultiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools\\n\\nand are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example,\\n\\nthree characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.\\n\\nWhile crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for\\n\\nmore information on lifestyle expenses).\\n\\nPracticing a Profession\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities,\\n\\nbut also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability.\\n\\nA score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the\\n\\nhighest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.\\n\\nEach ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and\\n\\nModifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.\\n\\nAbility Scores and Modifiers Table\\n\\nScore Modifier\\n\\n1 -5\\n\\n2-3 -4\\n\\n4-5 -3\\n\\n6-7 -2\\n\\n8-9 -1\\n\\n10-11 +0\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

When that\\n\\nhappens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have\\n\\ndisadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use\\n\\nthe 17.\\n\\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two\\n\\nfavorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\\n\\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even\\n\\nif multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor\\n\\ndisadvantage.\\n\\nWhen you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or\\n\\nreplace only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the\\n\\nhalfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.\\n\\nYou usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage (as\\n\\nexplained in chapter 4, “Personality and Background”). The DM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant\\n\\nadvantage or impose disadvantage as a result.\\n\\nProficiency Bonus\\n\\nCharacters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat\\n\\nblocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.\\n\\nYour proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your\\n\\nproficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\\n\\nOccasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise\\n\\nfeature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the\\n\\nsame roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any\\n\\nnumber is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus\\n\\nwhen you make Intelligence (History) checks.\\n\\nIn general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.\\n\\nAbility Checks\\n\\nAn ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a\\n\\ncharacter or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the\\n\\nresults.\\n\\nFor every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty\\n\\nClass. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\\n\\nTypical Difficulty Classes\\n\\nTask Difficulty DC\\n\\nVery easy 5\\n\\nEasy 10\\n\\nMedium 15\\n\\nHard 20\\n\\nVery hard 25\\n\\nNearly impossible 30\\n\\nTo make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the\\n\\nDC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success — the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which\\n\\nmeans the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.\\n\\nContests\\n\\nSometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and\\n\\nonly one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to\\n\\nprevent the other one from accomplishing a goal — for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In\\n\\nsituations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\\n\\nBoth participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing\\n\\nthe total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster\\n\\neither succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.\\n\\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two\\n\\ncharacters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer\\n\\ntrying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.\\n\\nSkills\\n\\nEach ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of\\n\\nan ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at\\n\\ncharacter creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Each of these aspects\\n\\nof Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is\\n\\nparticularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.\\n\\nThe skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s description in the later sections\\n\\nof this chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.\\n\\nStrength\\n\\nAthletics\\n\\nDexterity\\n\\nAcrobatics\\n\\nSleight of Hand\\n\\nStealth\\n\\nIntelligence\\n\\nArcana\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nInvestigation\\n\\nNature\\n\\nReligion\\n\\nWisdom\\n\\nAnimal Handling\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nMedicine\\n\\nPerception\\n\\nSurvival\\n\\nCharisma\\n\\nDeception\\n\\nIntimidation\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nPersuasion\\n\\nSometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill — for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might\\n\\nask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency\\n\\nbonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.\\n\\nFor example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the DM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in\\n\\nAthletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.\\n\\nVariant: Skills with Different Abilities\\n\\nNormally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks.\\n\\nIn some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an\\n\\nunusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim\\n\\nfrom an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your\\n\\nDM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your\\n\\nproficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a\\n\\ndisplay of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated\\n\\nwith Charisma.\\n\\nPassive Checks\\n\\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done\\n\\nrepeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether the characters\\n\\nsucceed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.\\n\\nHere’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:\\n\\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\\n\\nIf the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.\\n\\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.\\n\\nThe rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in chapter 8, “Adventuring.”\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The character who’s leading the effort — or the one with the highest ability modifier — can\\n\\nmake an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action (see chapter 9,\\n\\n“Combat”).\\n\\nA character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’\\n\\ntools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals\\n\\nworking together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\\n\\nGroup Checks\\n\\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the\\n\\ncharacters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.\\n\\nTo make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise,\\n\\nthe group fails.\\n\\nGroup checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are\\n\\nnavigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural\\n\\nhazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the\\n\\ngroup stumbles into one of these hazards.\\n\\nUsing Each Ability\\n\\nEvery task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those\\n\\nabilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\\n\\nStrength\\n\\nStrength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\\n\\nStrength Checks\\n\\nA Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a\\n\\nsituation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.\\n\\nAthletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following\\n\\nactivities:\\n\\nYou attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Or another creature tries to push or pull\\n\\nyou underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\\n\\nOther Strength Checks\\n\\nThe DM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\\n\\nForce open a stuck, locked, or barred door\\n\\nBreak free of bonds\\n\\nPush through a tunnel that is too small\\n\\nHang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it\\n\\nTip over a statue\\n\\nKeep a boulder from rolling\\n\\nAttack Rolls and Damage\\n\\nYou add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You\\n\\nuse melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.\\n\\nLifting and Carrying\\n\\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\\n\\nCarrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough\\n\\nthat most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.\\n\\nPush, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or\\n\\ndragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.\\n\\nSize and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the\\n\\ncreature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\\n\\nVariant: Encumbrance\\n\\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is\\n\\nhindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table in chapter 5.\\n\\nIf you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.\\n\\nIf you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means\\n\\nyour speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\\n\\nDexterity\\n\\nDexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\\n\\nDexterity Checks\\n\\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and\\n\\nStealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\\n\\nAcrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a\\n\\nsheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can\\n\\nperform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\\n\\nSleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on\\n\\nyour person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a\\n\\ncoin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak\\n\\nup on someone without being seen or heard.\\n\\nOther Dexterity Checks. The DM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\\n\\nControl a heavily laden cart on a steep descent\\n\\nSteer a chariot around a tight turn\\n\\nPick a lock\\n\\nDisable a trap\\n\\nSecurely tie up a prisoner\\n\\nWriggle free of bonds\\n\\nPlay a stringed instrument\\n\\nCraft a small or detailed object\\n\\nAttack Rolls and Damage\\n\\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also\\n\\nadd your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger\\n\\nor a rapier.\\n\\nArmor Class\\n\\nDepending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, as described in chapter 5, \"Equipment.\"\\n\\nInitiative\\n\\nAt the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat, as described\\n\\nin chapter 9, \"Combat.\"\\n\\nConstitution\\n\\nConstitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\\n\\nConstitution Checks\\n\\nConstitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than\\n\\ninvolving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.\\n\\nThe DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.\\n\\nIf your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you\\n\\nraise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as\\n\\nthough the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new\\n\\nmodifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is\\n\\nreduced by 7.\\n\\nIntelligence\\n\\nIntelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.\\n\\nIntelligence Checks\\n\\nAn Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation,\\n\\nNature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.\\n\\nArcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of\\n\\nexistence, and the inhabitants of those planes.\\n\\nHistory. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes,\\n\\nrecent wars, and lost civilizations.\\n\\nInvestigation. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might\\n\\ndeduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel\\n\\nthat could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence\\n\\n(Investigation) check.\\n\\nNature.

The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\\n\\nAnimal Handling. When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an\\n\\nanimal’s intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount\\n\\nwhen you attempt a risky maneuver.\\n\\nInsight. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting\\n\\nsomeone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\\n\\nMedicine. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\\n\\nPerception. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of\\n\\nyour surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open\\n\\nwindow, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in\\n\\nambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\\n\\nSurvival. The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify\\n\\nsigns that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\\n\\nOther Wisdom Checks. The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\\n\\nGet a gut feeling about what course of action to follow\\n\\nDiscern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead\\n\\nSpellcasting Ability\\n\\nClerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\\n\\nCharisma\\n\\nCharisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming\\n\\nor commanding personality.\\n\\nCharisma Checks\\n\\nA Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are\\n\\nnavigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\\n\\nDeception. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This\\n\\ndeception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a\\n\\nguard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a\\n\\nstraight face while telling a blatant lie.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a\\n\\nCharisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or\\n\\nusing the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\\n\\nPerformance. Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other\\n\\nform of entertainment.\\n\\nPersuasion. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a\\n\\nCharisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper\\n\\netiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or\\n\\ninspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\\n\\nOther Charisma Checks. The DM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\\n\\nFind the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip\\n\\nBlend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation\\n\\nSpellcasting Ability\\n\\nBards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\\n\\nSaving Throws\\n\\nA saving throw — also called a save — represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to\\n\\nmake a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.\\n\\nTo make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.\\n\\nA saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Roars of fury, shouts of triumph, cries\\n\\nof pain. Combat in D&D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.\\n\\nThis chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and monsters to engage in combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a\\n\\ndungeon or on a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master. The Dungeon Master controls all the\\n\\nmonsters and nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other player controls an adventurer. “You” can also mean the character or monster that\\n\\nyou control.\\n\\nThe Order of Combat\\n\\nA typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting.

The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the\\n\\nfight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.\\n\\nSurprise\\n\\nA band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage,\\n\\nunnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.\\n\\nThe DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the\\n\\nDexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster\\n\\nthat doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.\\n\\nIf you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a\\n\\ngroup can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.\\n\\nInitiative\\n\\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the\\n\\ninitiative order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.\\n\\nThe DM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative\\n\\norder) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.\\n\\nIf a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM can\\n\\ndecide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to\\n\\ndetermine the order, highest roll going first.\\n\\nYour Turn\\n\\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed —\\n\\nsometimes called your walking speed — is noted on your character sheet.\\n\\nThe most common actions you can take are described in the \"Actions in Combat\" section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities\\n\\nprovide additional options for your action.\\n\\nThe \"Movement and Position\" section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.\\n\\nYou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or\\n\\nReady action, as described in \"Actions in Combat.\"\\n\\nBonus Actions\\n\\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for\\n\\nexample, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you\\n\\ncan do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.\\n\\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

For example, you could open a door\\n\\nduring your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.\\n\\nIf you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as\\n\\nstated in their descriptions.\\n\\nThe DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the\\n\\nDM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\\n\\nReactions\\n\\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some\\n\\nkind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.\\n\\nWhen you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can\\n\\ncontinue its turn right after the reaction.\\n\\nMovement and Position\\n\\nIn combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.\\n\\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.\\n\\nYour movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute\\n\\nyour entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done\\n\\nmoving.\\n\\nThe “Special Types of Movement” section in chapter 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, and swimming.\\n\\nBreaking Up Your Move\\n\\nYou can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can\\n\\nmove 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.\\n\\nMoving Between Attacks\\n\\nIf you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For\\n\\nexample, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15\\n\\nfeet, and then attack again.\\n\\nUsing Different Speeds\\n\\nIf you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move.\\n\\nWhenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the\\n\\nresult is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.\\n\\nFor example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then\\n\\nleap into the air to fly 30 feet more.\\n\\nDifficult Terrain\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases — the setting of a\\n\\ntypical fight contains difficult terrain.\\n\\nEvery foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.\\n\\nLow furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or\\n\\nnot, also counts as difficult terrain.\\n\\nBeing Prone\\n\\nCombatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they\\n\\nare prone.\\n\\nYou can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For\\n\\nexample, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your\\n\\nspeed is 0.\\n\\nTo move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation.

In contrast, you can move through a hostile\\n\\ncreature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that\\n\\nanother creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.\\n\\nWhether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.\\n\\nIf you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained\\n\\nlater in the chapter.\\n\\nFlying Movement\\n\\nFlying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a\\n\\nflying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move,\\n\\nthe creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.\\n\\nCreature Size\\n\\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a\\n\\ncreature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.\\n\\nSize Categories\\n\\nSize Space\\n\\nTiny 2 ½ by 2 ½ ft.\\n\\nSmall 5 by 5 ft.\\n\\nMedium 5 by 5 ft.\\n\\nLarge 10 by 10 ft.\\n\\nHuge 15 by 15 ft.\\n\\nGargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger\\n\\nSpace\\n\\nA creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5\\n\\nfeet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through\\n\\nunless the hobgoblin lets them.\\n\\nA creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another\\n\\ncreature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.\\n\\nBecause larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one,\\n\\nthere’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.\\n\\nSqueezing into a Smaller Space\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage\\n\\nthat’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on\\n\\nattack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.\\n\\nActions in Combat\\n\\nWhen you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an\\n\\naction that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.\\n\\nWhen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if\\n\\nany, to determine success or failure.\\n\\nAttack\\n\\nThe most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.\\n\\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the \"Making an Attack\" section for the rules that govern attacks.\\n\\nCertain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.\\n\\nCast a Spell\\n\\nSpellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a\\n\\ncasting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not\\n\\nnecessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See\\n\\nchapter 10 for the rules on spellcasting.\\n\\nDash\\n\\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed\\n\\nof 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.\\n\\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for\\n\\ninstance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.\\n\\nDisengage\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has\\n\\ndisadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your\\n\\nspeed drops to 0.\\n\\nHelp\\n\\nYou can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next\\n\\nability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make\\n\\nyour ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.\\n\\nHide\\n\\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain\\n\\nbenefits, as described in the \"Unseen Attackers and Targets\" section later in this chapter.\\n\\nReady\\n\\nSometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn,\\n\\nwhich lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.\\n\\nFirst, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you\\n\\nchoose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include \"If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,\" and \"If the goblin\\n\\nsteps next to me, I move away.\"\\n\\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.\\n\\nWhen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must\\n\\nhave a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your concentration is broken, the\\n\\nspell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take\\n\\ndamage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\\n\\nSearch\\n\\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a\\n\\nWisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\\n\\nUse an Object\\n\\nYou normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action\\n\\nfor its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.\\n\\n2. Determine modifiers. The DM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have\\n\\nadvantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects\\n\\ncan apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.\\n\\n3. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack\\n\\nhas rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of\\n\\ndamage.\\n\\nIf there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if\\n\\nyou’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.\\n\\nAttack Rolls\\n\\nWhen you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an\\n\\nattack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or\\n\\nexceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character\\n\\ncreation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.\\n\\nModifiers to the Roll\\n\\nWhen a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a\\n\\nmonster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.\\n\\nAbility Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity.\\n\\nWeapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.\\n\\nSome spells also require an attack roll.

This is true\\n\\nwhether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not\\n\\nsee. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just\\n\\nsays that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.\\n\\nWhen a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it.\\n\\nIf you are hidden — both unseen and unheard — when you make an attack, you give away your\\n\\nlocation when the attack hits or misses.\\n\\nRanged Attacks\\n\\nWhen you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might\\n\\nshoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.\\n\\nRange\\n\\nYou can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.\\n\\nIf a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.\\n\\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger\\n\\nnumber is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.\\n\\nRanged Attacks in Close Combat\\n\\nAiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have\\n\\ndisadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.\\n\\nMelee Attacks\\n\\nUsed in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a\\n\\nsword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few\\n\\nspells also involve making a melee attack.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Certain creatures (typically those larger\\n\\nthan Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.\\n\\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of\\n\\nwhich count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed\\n\\nstrikes.\\n\\nOpportunity Attacks\\n\\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.\\n\\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your\\n\\nreaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.\\n\\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when\\n\\nsomeone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion\\n\\nhurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\\n\\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\\n\\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a\\n\\ndifferent light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that\\n\\nmodifier is negative.\\n\\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\\n\\nGrappling\\n\\nWhen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make\\n\\nmultiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\\n\\nThe target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the\\n\\ntarget by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity\\n\\n(Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target\\n\\nto the grappled condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\\n\\nEscaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check\\n\\ncontested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\\n\\nMoving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or\\n\\nmore sizes smaller than you.\\n\\nShoving a Creature\\n\\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make\\n\\nmultiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\\n\\nThe target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics)\\n\\ncheck contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if\\n\\nthe target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.\\n\\nCover\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

A target can benefit from cover only\\n\\nwhen an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.\\n\\nThere are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added\\n\\ntogether. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters\\n\\ncover.\\n\\nHalf Cover\\n\\nA target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The\\n\\nobstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.\\n\\nThree-Quarters Cover\\n\\nA target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is\\n\\ncovered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.\\n\\nTotal Cover\\n\\nA target with total cover can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect.\\n\\nA target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.\\n\\nDamage and Healing\\n\\nInjury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of\\n\\nflame from a fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.\\n\\nHit Points\\n\\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those\\n\\nwith fewer hit points are more fragile.\\n\\nA creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes\\n\\nfrequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\\n\\nWhenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the\\n\\ncreature drops to 0 hit points.\\n\\nDamage Rolls\\n\\nEach weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage\\n\\nto your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.\\n\\nWith a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.\\n\\nWhen attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier — the same modifier used for the attack roll — to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to\\n\\nroll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.\\n\\nIf a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts\\n\\nfireball or a cleric casts flame strike, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.\\n\\nCritical Hits\\n\\nWhen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them\\n\\ntogether. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The corrosive spray of an adult black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.\\n\\nBludgeoning. Blunt force attacks — hammers, falling, constriction, and the like — deal bludgeoning damage.\\n\\nCold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a young white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.\\n\\nFire. Ancient red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.\\n\\nForce. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual\\n\\nweapon.\\n\\nLightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon wyrmling’s breath deal lightning damage.\\n\\nNecrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul.\\n\\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.\\n\\nPoison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of an adult green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.\\n\\nPsychic. Mental abilities such as a psionic blast deal psychic damage.\\n\\nRadiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\\n\\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.\\n\\nThunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\\n\\nDamage Resistance and Vulnerability\\n\\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\\n\\nIf a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage\\n\\ntype, damage of that type is doubled against it.\\n\\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit\\n\\nby an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced\\n\\nby 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\\n\\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to\\n\\nfire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by\\n\\nthree-quarters.\\n\\nHealing\\n\\nUnless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points (as explained\\n\\nin chapter 8), and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.\\n\\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point\\n\\nmaximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14\\n\\ncurrent hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.\\n\\nA creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals\\n\\nor exceeds your hit point maximum.\\n\\nFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but\\n\\n12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\\n\\nFalling Unconscious\\n\\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\\n\\nDeath Saving Throws\\n\\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer\\n\\nto death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and\\n\\nfeatures that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.\\n\\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable\\n\\n(see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The\\n\\nnumber of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\\n\\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\\n\\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you\\n\\nsuffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\\n\\nStabilizing a Creature\\n\\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed\\n\\ndeath saving throw.\\n\\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom\\n\\n(Medicine) check.\\n\\nA stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and\\n\\nmust start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack,\\n\\nthe attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\\n\\nTemporary Hit Points\\n\\nSome spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage,\\n\\na pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\\n\\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit\\n\\npoints. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\\n\\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit\\n\\npoints and receive temporary hit points.\\n\\nHealing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide\\n\\nwhether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can\\n\\nhave 12 or 10, not 22.\\n\\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you\\n\\nwhile you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.\\n\\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.\\n\\nMounted Combat\\n\\nA knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy\\n\\nthe benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.\\n\\nA willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.\\n\\nMounting and Dismounting\\n\\nOnce during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your\\n\\nspeed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet\\n\\nof movement left or if your speed is 0.\\n\\nIf an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in\\n\\na space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.\\n\\nIf your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a\\n\\nspace within 5 feet it.\\n\\nControlling a Mount\\n\\nWhile you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act\\n\\nindependently.\\n\\nYou can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such\\n\\ntraining. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options:\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

       " 'PREFACE CH. 1: STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-\\n\\nbelieve. Like those games, D&D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy\\n\\nadventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.\\n\\nUnlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to\\n\\nresolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some\\n\\nother dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.\\n\\nIn the Dungeons & Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends).\\n\\nWorking together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a\\n\\nmysterious mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items and\\n\\nother treasure.\\n\\nOne player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The DM creates adventures for the characters,\\n\\nwho navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the players decide what they\\n\\nwant their adventurers to do. Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that\\n\\nsomeone will fall if the drawbridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?\\n\\nThen the DM determines the results of the adventurers’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the\\n\\nplayers attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.\\n\\nThe game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a campaign. Many people who play\\n\\nthe game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The\\n\\nDungeon Master (DM): After passing through the craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling towers of\\n\\nstone keep a silent watch over the approach. They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. A\\n\\nlowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron\\n\\nstraining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with\\n\\ngrowth, hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into the courtyard.\\n\\nPhillip (playing Gareth): I want to look at the gargoyles. I have a feeling they’re not just statues.\\n\\nAmy (playing Riva): The drawbridge looks precarious? I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?\\n\\nDungeon Master (DM): OK, one at a time. Phillip, you’re looking at the gargoyles?\\n\\nPhillip: Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures and not decorations?\\n\\nDM: Make an Intelligence check.\\n\\nPhillip: Does my Investigation skill apply?\\n\\nDM: Sure!\\n\\nPhillip (rolling a d20): Ugh. Seven.\\n\\nDM: They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is checking out the drawbridge?\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure recovered not only adds to\\n\\nthe continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer’s level.\\n\\nThere’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons & Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the DM and the\\n\\nplayers create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by\\n\\nferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the\\n\\nplayer might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time\\n\\nand created a memorable story, they all win.\\n\\nWorlds of Adventure\\n\\nThe many worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game are places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. They begin with a\\n\\nfoundation of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and magic that make these worlds unique.\\n\\nThe worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game exist within a vast cosmos called the multiverse, connected in strange and mysterious ways to one another\\n\\nand to other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane of Fire and the Infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within this multiverse are an endless variety of\\n\\nworlds. Many of them have been published as official settings for the D&D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun,\\n\\nMystara, and Eberron settings are woven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created by\\n\\ngenerations of D&D players for their own games. And amid all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a world of your own.\\n\\nAll these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and races, fantastic geography,\\n\\nancient dungeons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun setting, for example, are jungle-\\n\\ndwelling cannibals, and the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s warforged, soldiers created\\n\\nand imbued with life to fight in the Last War. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role in the\\n\\nDragonlance setting. But they’re all D&D worlds, and you can use the rules here to create a character and play in any one of them.\\n\\nYour DM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of D&D,\\n\\nyou should check with your DM about any house rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is the authority on the\\n\\ncampaign and its setting, even if the setting is a published world.\\n\\nUsing This Book\\n\\nThe Player’s Handbook is divided into three parts.\\n\\nPart 1 (chapters 1–6) is about creating a character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you’ll play in the game. It includes\\n\\ninformation on the various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in part 1\\n\\nrely on material in parts 2 and 3. If you come across a game concept in part 1 that you don’t understand, consult the book’s index.\\n\\nPart 2 (chapters 7–9) details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you\\n\\nmake to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game: exploration,\\n\\ninteraction, and combat.\\n\\nPart 3 (chapters 10–11) is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic in the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and the huge variety of spells\\n\\navailable to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game.\\n\\nHow to Play\\n\\nThe play of the Dungeons & Dragons game unfolds according to this basic pattern.\\n\\n1. The DM describes the environment. The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of\\n\\noptions that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).\\n\\n2. The players describe what they want to do. Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other\\n\\ntimes, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how\\n\\nto resolve those actions.\\n\\nSometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and\\n\\ndescribe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging\\n\\nfor an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an\\n\\naction.\\n\\n3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’ actions. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the\\n\\ngame right back to step 1.\\n\\nThis pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon.\\n\\nIn certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most\\n\\nof the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.\\n\\nOften the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs\\n\\nlike to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers,\\n\\nmonsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each\\n\\ncreature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.\\n\\nGame Dice\\n\\nThe game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.\\n\\nIn these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-\\n\\nsided die (the typical cube that many games use).\\n\\nPercentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9.\\n\\nOne die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two\\n\\n0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In\\n\\nthis case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.\\n\\nWhen you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you\\n\\nroll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.\\n\\nThe same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To\\n\\nsimulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than\\n\\nhalf the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)\\n\\nThe D20\\n\\nDoes an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim\\n\\nacross a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of\\n\\nan action is uncertain, the Dungeons & Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.\\n\\nEvery character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence,\\n\\nWisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These\\n\\nability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.\\n\\nAbility checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple\\n\\nsteps.\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Roll the die and add a modifier. Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and\\n\\nit sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See Chapter 1 for details on each ability and how to determine an\\n\\nability’s modifier.)\\n\\n2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty\\n\\nto the check.\\n\\n3. Compare the total to a target number. If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success.\\n\\nOtherwise, it’s a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and\\n\\nsaving throws succeed or fail.\\n\\nThe target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class\\n\\n(AC).\\n\\nThis simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play. Chapter 7, \"Using Ability Scores\" provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the\\n\\ngame.\\n\\nAdvantage and Disadvantage\\n\\nSometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the\\n\\npositive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a\\n\\nsecond d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if\\n\\nyou have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\\n\\nMore detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in chapter 7.\\n\\nSpecific Beats General\\n\\nThis compendium contains rules that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and\\n\\nother game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule\\n\\ncontradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.\\n\\nExceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don’t have proficiency with longbows, but every wood elf does because of a racial\\n\\ntrait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can’t normally\\n\\npass through walls, but some spells make that possible.

Each character\\n\\nbrings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, and magic items. Every\\n\\ncharacter is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and\\n\\ncover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.\\n\\nThe adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or\\n\\npurchased off the shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM’s needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, whether it’s an\\n\\nunderground dungeon, a crumbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and\\n\\nplayed by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just\\n\\nbackground extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action.\\n\\nOver the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way.\\n\\nSometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another\\n\\ncreature (or even a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something\\n\\nhidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they’ll try to\\n\\ndo next.\\n\\nAdventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to\\n\\ncomplete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching\\n\\nover weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to their home base to rest and enjoy the\\n\\nspoils of their labors.\\n\\nBut that’s not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is\\n\\nthe whole series—a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.\\n\\nThe Three Pillars of Adventure\\n\\nAdventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social\\n\\ninteraction, and combat.\\n\\nExploration includes both the adventurers’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention.\\n\\nExploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling the players what happens\\n\\nas a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through caverns\\n\\nunderground. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see what happens.\\n\\nSocial interaction features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the secret\\n\\nentrance to the goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading a talkative magic mirror to\\n\\nshow a distant location to the adventurers.\\n\\nThe rules in part 2 (especially \"Using Ability Scores\" and \"Adventuring\") support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in \"Classes\"\\n\\nand personality traits in \"Personality and Background.\"\\n\\nCombat, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an\\n\\neffort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a\\n\\nD&D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there’s still plenty of\\n\\nopportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling a\\n\\nmysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.\\n\\nThe Wonders of Magic\\n\\nFew D&D adventures end without something magical happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is\\n\\nthe focus of part 3.\\n\\nIn the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons, practitioners of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people by their extraordinary talent. Common folk\\n\\nmight see evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it’s usually minor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, a wizard walking through the streets\\n\\nThe Gri�on\\'s Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The four elements that make up a world — air, earth, fire, and water — must remain in equilibrium. If one\\n\\nelement were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component\\n\\nelements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.\\n\\nDruids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for people to live in harmony with nature,\\n\\nnot in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind\\n\\nflayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the\\n\\ndruids’ territory.\\n\\nDruids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature’s\\n\\nbalance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.\\n\\nCreating a Druid\\n\\nWhen making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still\\n\\nthrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of\\n\\nnature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic\\n\\neruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character’s destiny.\\n\\nHave you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your\\n\\nhomeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.\\n\\nQuick Build\\n\\nYou can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.

See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting\\n\\nand chapter 11 for the druid spell list.\\n\\nCantrips\\n\\nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in\\n\\nthe Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.\\n\\nPreparing and Casting Spells\\n\\nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a\\n\\nslot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\\n\\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells\\n\\nequal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\\n\\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include\\n\\nsix spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting\\n\\nthe spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\\n\\nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and\\n\\nmeditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\\n\\nSpellcasting Ability\\n\\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom\\n\\nwhenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast\\n\\nand when making an attack roll with one.\\n\\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\\n\\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\\n\\nRitual Casting\\n\\nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\\n\\nSpellcasting Focus\\n\\nYou can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.\\n\\nWild Shape\\n\\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You\\n\\nregain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\\n\\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any\\n\\nbeast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

CR Limitations Example\\n\\n2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf\\n\\n4th 1/2 No flying speed Crocodile\\n\\n8th 1 — Giant eagle\\n\\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend\\n\\nanother use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall\\n\\nunconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\\n\\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\\n\\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma\\n\\nscores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same\\n\\nproficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary\\n\\nor lair actions, you can’t use them.\\n\\nWhen you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points\\n\\nyou had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.\\n\\nFor example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage\\n\\ndoesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.\\n\\nYou can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming\\n\\ndoesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call\\n\\nlightning, that you’ve already cast.\\n\\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.\\n\\nHowever, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\\n\\nYou choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as\\n\\nnormal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your\\n\\nequipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or\\n\\nmerge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.\\n\\nDruid Circle\\n\\nAt 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description.\\n\\nYour choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\\n\\nAbility Score Improvement\\n\\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability\\n\\nscores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\\n\\nTimeless Body\\n\\nStarting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.\\n\\nBeast Spells\\n\\nBeginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal\\n\\ncomponents of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.\\n\\nArchdruid\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.\\n\\nDruid Circles\\n\\nThough their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally\\n\\nmembers of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or\\n\\nparticipated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes\\n\\ncompete with or even prey on each other.\\n\\nAt a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.\\n\\nCircle of the Land\\n\\nThe Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within\\n\\nsacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities\\n\\nthat hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were\\n\\ninitiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.\\n\\nBonus Cantrip\\n\\nWhen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. This cantrip doesn’t count against the number of druid\\n\\ncantrips you know.\\n\\nNatural Recovery\\n\\nStarting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose\\n\\nexpended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the\\n\\nslots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\\n\\nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level\\n\\nslots.\\n\\nCircle Spells\\n\\nYour mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells\\n\\nconnected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land — arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark — and\\n\\nconsult the associated list of spells.\\n\\nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

       " \"MONK RANGER\\n\\nPaladin\\n\\nClad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on\\n\\na mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.\\n\\nA dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory.\\n\\nSilently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.\\n\\nSilver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and\\n\\nagain at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.\\n\\nWhatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the\\n\\nwitness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a\\n\\npaladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.\\n\\nThe Cause of Righteousness\\n\\nA paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces\\n\\nof evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power\\n\\nto do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it\\n\\ndoes from a god.\\n\\nPaladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical\\n\\npower they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight\\n\\nfor justice.\\n\\nBeyond the Mundane Life\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin\\n\\nlives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer\\n\\npeople can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight\\n\\nevil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of\\n\\nrighteousness, not to crown and country.\\n\\nAdventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of\\n\\ntreasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.\\n\\nCreating a Paladin\\n\\nThe most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don’t appear until\\n\\nyou reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the\\n\\ngods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything\\n\\nbeautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner\\n\\nsworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists\\n\\nmany deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut,\\n\\nAthena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.\\n\\nHow did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin\\n\\nsense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event — the destruction of your home, perhaps — drive you to your\\n\\nquests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty.\\n\\nOr you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin’s life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that\\n\\npurpose stamped on your soul.\\n\\nAs guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how\\n\\nyour alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and\\n\\nalignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.\\n\\nQuick Build\\n\\nYou can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose\\n\\nthe noble background.\\n\\nThe Paladin\\n\\n\\xa0 — Spell Slots per Spell Level —\\n\\nLevel\\nProficiency\\n\\nBonus Features 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th\\n\\n1st +2 Divine Sense, Lay on Hands — — — — —\\n\\n2nd +2 Fighting Style, Spellcasting, Divine Smite 2 — — — —\\n\\n3rd +2 Divine Health, Sacred Oath 3 — — — —\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

As an action, you can\\n\\nopen your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you\\n\\nthat is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire\\n\\nCount Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or\\n\\ndesecrated, as with the hallow spell.\\n\\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.\\n\\nLay on Hands\\n\\nYour blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total\\n\\nnumber of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.\\n\\nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount\\n\\nremaining in your pool.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure\\n\\nmultiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.\\n\\nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs.\\n\\nFighting Style\\n\\nAt 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once,\\n\\neven if you later get to choose again.\\n\\nDefense\\n\\nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\\n\\nDueling\\n\\nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.\\n\\nGreat Weapon Fighting\\n\\nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must\\n\\nuse the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.\\n\\nProtection\\n\\nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack\\n\\nroll. You must be wielding a shield.\\n\\nSpellcasting\\n\\nBy 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules\\n\\nof spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.\\n\\nPreparing and Casting Spells\\n\\nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must\\n\\nexpend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\\n\\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin\\n\\nspells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have\\n\\nspell slots.\\n\\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can\\n\\ninclude four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\\n\\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation:\\n\\nat least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\\n\\nSpellcasting Ability\\n\\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma\\n\\nwhenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you\\n\\ncast and when making an attack roll with one.\\n\\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\\n\\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\\n\\nSpellcasting Focus\\n\\nYou can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.\\n\\nDivine Smite\\n\\nStarting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to\\n\\nthe weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage\\n\\nincreases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.\\n\\nDivine Health\\n\\nBy 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.\\n\\nSacred Oath\\n\\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the\\n\\npath but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class\\n\\ndescription.\\n\\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.\\n\\nOath Spells\\n\\nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath\\n\\nspell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\\n\\nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.\\n\\nChannel Divinity\\n\\nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.\\n\\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\\n\\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.

You must be conscious to grant this bonus.\\n\\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\\n\\nAura of Courage\\n\\nStarting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.\\n\\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\\n\\nImproved Divine Smite\\n\\nBy 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with\\n\\na melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.\\n\\nCleansing Touch\\n\\nBeginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.\\n\\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.\\n\\nSacred Oaths\\n\\nBecoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath,\\n\\ntaken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true\\n\\npaladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has\\n\\nalways been true in the paladin’s heart.\\n\\nOath of Devotion\\n\\nThe Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these\\n\\npaladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest\\n\\nstandards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of\\n\\nlaw and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels — the perfect servants of good — as their ideals, and\\n\\nincorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.\\n\\nTenets of Devotion\\n\\nThough the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.\\n\\nHonesty. Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights,\\n\\npaladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving\\n\\nthings of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of\\n\\ngrowing things — leaves, antlers, or flowers — to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.\\n\\nTenets of the Ancients\\n\\nThe tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of\\n\\nlaw or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.\\n\\nKindle the Light. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.\\n\\nShelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes,\\n\\nstand against the forces that would render it barren.\\n\\nPreserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can’t preserve it in the world.\\n\\nBe the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.\\n\\nOath Spells\\n\\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\\n\\nOath of the Ancients Spells\\n\\nPaladin Level Spells\\n\\n3rd ensnaring strike, speak with animals\\n\\n5th misty step, moonbeam\\n\\n9th plant growth, protection from energy\\n\\n13th ice storm, stoneskin\\n\\n17th commune with nature, tree stride\\n\\nChannel Divinity\\n\\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.\\n\\nNature’s Wrath.

While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines\\n\\nvanish.\\n\\nTurn the Faithless. You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy\\n\\nsymbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1\\n\\nminute or until it takes damage.\\n\\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also\\n\\ncan’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move,\\n\\nthe creature can use the Dodge action.\\n\\nIf the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.\\n\\nAura of Warding\\n\\nBeginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have\\n\\nresistance to damage from spells.\\n\\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\\n\\nUndying Sentinel\\n\\nStarting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this\\n\\nability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.\\n\\nAdditionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can’t be aged magically.\\n\\nElder Champion\\n\\nAt 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take\\n\\non a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or moss-like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.\\n\\nUsing your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:\\n\\nAt the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.\\n\\nWhenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.\\n\\nEnemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.\\n\\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.\\n\\nOath of Vengeance\\n\\nThe Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when\\n\\nan entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside\\n\\n— at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins — sometimes called\\n\\navengers or dark knights — their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.\\n\\nTenets of Vengeance\\n\\nThe tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who\\n\\nuphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or\\n\\nlawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.\\n\\nFight the Greater Evil. Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.\\n\\nNo Mercy for the Wicked.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60\\n\\nfeet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have\\n\\ndisadvantage on this saving throw.\\n\\nOn a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from\\n\\nany bonus to its speed.\\n\\nOn a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.\\n\\nVow of Enmity. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain\\n\\nadvantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.\\n\\nRelentless Avenger\\n\\nBy 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your\\n\\nspeed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.\\n\\nSoul of Vengeance\\n\\nStarting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of\\n\\nyour Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.\\n\\nAvenging Angel\\n\\nAt 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:\\n\\nWings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.\\n\\nYou emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the\\n\\ncreature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the\\n\\nfrightened creature have advantage.\\n\\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

       " \"DRUID MONK\\n\\nFighter\\n\\nA human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor,\\n\\npeppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to\\n\\nthe best advantage.\\n\\nA dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale\\n\\narmor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.\\n\\nA gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd’s delight — and his\\n\\nown tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.\\n\\nAll of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. Questing knights, conquering\\n\\noverlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings — as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons\\n\\nand armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the\\n\\nface.\\n\\nWell-Rounded Specialists\\n\\nFighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even\\n\\ntrap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each\\n\\nfighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their\\n\\nmartial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in\\n\\ndungeons alike.\\n\\nTrained for Danger\\n\\nNot every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the\\n\\nmost basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among\\n\\nadventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater\\n\\nrewards — few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.\\n\\nCreating a Fighter\\n\\nAs you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character’s background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart\\n\\nfrom the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional\\n\\ndedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have\\n\\nbeen factors.\\n\\nYou might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military\\n\\nhistory. Or you might be self-taught — unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you\\n\\nfollowing a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps\\n\\nyou scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions — the only things that stand between\\n\\nyou and death’s embrace.\\n\\nQuick Build\\n\\nYou can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want\\n\\nto focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the\\n\\nEldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose the soldier background.\\n\\nThe Fighter\\n\\nLevel Proficiency\\nBonus Features\\n\\n1st +2 Fighting Style, Second Wind\\n\\n2nd +2 Action Surge (one use)\\n\\n3rd +2 Martial Archetype\\n\\n4th +2 Ability Score Improvement\\n\\n5th +3 Extra Attack\\n\\n6th +3 Ability Score Improvement\\n\\n7th +3 Martial Archetype Feature\\n\\n8th +3 Ability Score Improvement\\n\\n9th +4 Indomitable (one use)\\n\\n10th +4 Martial Archetype Feature\\n\\n11th +4 Extra Attack (2)\\n\\n12th +4 Ability Score Improvement\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the\\n\\nnumber you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.\\n\\nPrecision Attack. When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this\\n\\nmaneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.\\n\\nPushing Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the\\n\\nsuperiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target\\n\\nup to 15 feet away from you.\\n\\nRally.

Eldritch Knights use magical\\n\\ntechniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells\\n\\ngrant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter’s reach in combat.\\n\\nThese knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.\\n\\nEldritch Knight Spellcasting\\n\\n\\xa0 — Spell Slots Per Level —\\n\\nFighter\\nLevel\\n\\nCantrips\\nKnown\\n\\nSpells\\nKnown\\n\\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th\\n\\n3rd 2 3 2 — — —\\n\\n4th 2 4 3 — — —\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and\\n\\nevocation spells on the wizard spell list.\\n\\nThe Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells\\n\\nmust be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this\\n\\nclass, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\\n\\nThe spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.\\n\\nWhenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The\\n\\nnew spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at\\n\\n3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.\\n\\nSpellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use\\n\\nyour Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a\\n\\nwizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\\n\\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\\n\\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Even within your class and race, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this\\n\\nchapter is for players who — with the DM’s permission — want to go a step further.\\n\\nThis chapter defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together,\\n\\nand feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your DM decides whether these options are\\n\\navailable in a campaign.\\n\\nMulticlassing\\n\\nMulticlassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not\\n\\nbe reflected in one of the standard class options.\\n\\nWith this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your\\n\\nlevels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level.

You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character\\n\\nof the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nTo qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing\\n\\nPrerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher.\\n\\nWithout the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by\\n\\nhigher-than-average ability scores.\\n\\nMulticlassing Prerequisites\\n\\nClass Ability Score Minimum\\n\\nBarbarian Strength 13\\n\\nBard Charisma 13\\n\\nCleric Wisdom 13\\n\\nDruid Wisdom 13\\n\\nFighter Strength 13 or Dexterity 13\\n\\nMonk Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13\\n\\nPaladin Strength 13 and Charisma 13\\n\\nRanger Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13\\n\\nRogue Dexterity 13\\n\\nSorcerer Charisma 13\\n\\nWarlock Charisma 13\\n\\nWizard Intelligence 13\\n\\nExperience Points\\n\\nThe experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your\\n\\nlevel in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter\\n\\nor your seventh level as a cleric.\\n\\nHit Points and Hit Dice\\n\\nYou gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level\\n\\ncharacter.\\n\\nYou add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them\\n\\ntogether. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit\\n\\nDice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.\\n\\nProficiency Bonus\\n\\nYour proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. For\\n\\nexample, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.\\n\\nProficiencies\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.\\n\\nEach spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell.\\n\\nSimilarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.\\n\\nIf a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.\\n\\nSpell Slots. You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels\\n\\n(rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane\\n\\nTrickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.\\n\\nIf you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can\\n\\nuse those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a\\n\\nhigher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that higher level.\\n\\nFor example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level\\n\\nslots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use\\n\\nthe spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know — and potentially enhance their effects.\\n\\nPact Magic. If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain\\n\\nfrom the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you\\n\\ngain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\\n\\nMulticlass Spellcaster\\n\\nLevel 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th\\n\\n1st 2 - - - - - - - -\\n\\n2nd 3 - - - - - - - -\\n\\n3rd 4 2 - - - - - - -\\n\\n4th 4 3 - - - - - - -\\n\\n5th 4 3 2 - - - - - -\\n\\n6th 4 3 3 - - - - - -\\n\\n7th 4 3 3 1 - - - - -\\n\\n8th 4 3 3 2 - - - - -\\n\\n9th 4 3 3 3 1 - - - -\\n\\n10th 4 3 3 3 2 - - - -\\n\\n11th 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - -\\n\\n12th 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - -\\n\\n13th 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - -\\n\\n14th 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - -\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a\\n\\nclass provides.\\n\\nAt certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat\\n\\nof your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.\\n\\nYou must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the\\n\\nprerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow — perhaps by a\\n\\nwithering curse — you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.\\n\\nFeats are listed below.\\n\\nActor\\n\\nSkilled at mimicry and dramatics, you gain the following benefits:\\n\\nIncrease your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\\n\\nYou have advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person.\\n\\nYou can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the\\n\\ncreature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check allows a\\n\\nlistener to determine that the effect is faked.\\n\\nAlert\\n\\nAlways on the lookout for danger, you gain the following benefits:\\n\\nYou gain a +5 bonus to initiative.\\n\\nYou can’t be surprised while you are conscious.\\n\\nOther creatures don’t gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being unseen by you.\\n\\nAthlete\\n\\nYou have undergone extensive physical training to gain the following benefits:\\n\\nIncrease your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\\n\\nWhen you are prone, standing up uses only 5 feet of your movement.\\n\\nClimbing doesn’t cost you extra movement.\\n\\nYou can make a running long jump or a running high jump after moving only 5 feet on foot, rather than 10 feet.\\n\\nCharger\\n\\nWhen you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature.\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

       " \"CH. 3: CLASSES BARD\\n\\nBarbarian\\n\\nA tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his\\n\\npeople’s elk herd.\\n\\nA half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.\\n\\nFrothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.\\n\\nThese barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their\\n\\nanger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.\\n\\nFor some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every\\n\\nbarbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.\\n\\nPrimal Instinct\\n\\nPeople of towns and cities take pride in their settled ways, as if denying one’s connection to nature were a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, a\\n\\nsettled life is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace nature—valuing keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are\\n\\nuncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live\\n\\nand hunt.\\n\\nBarbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A\\n\\nbarbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.\\n\\nA Life of Danger\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival\\n\\ntribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to.\\n\\nTheir courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the\\n\\nrootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them\\n\\nreplaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.\\n\\nCreating a Barbarian\\n\\nWhen creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an\\n\\nappropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a\\n\\nrough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?\\n\\nWhat led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to\\n\\nface a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of\\n\\nwar, brought in chains to another land and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you\\n\\ncommitted, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.\\n\\nQuick Build\\n\\nYou can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second,\\n\\nchoose the outlander background.\\n\\nThe Barbarian\\n\\nLevel Proficiency\\nBonus Features Rages Rage\\n\\nDamage\\n\\n1st +2 Rage, Unarmored Defense 2 +2\\n\\n2nd +2 Reckless Attack, Danger Sense 2 +2\\n\\n3rd +2 Primal Path 3 +2\\n\\n4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 +2\\n\\n5th +3 Extra Attack, Fast Movement 3 +2\\n\\n6th +3 Path Feature 4 +2\\n\\n7th +3 Feral Instinct 4 +2\\n\\n8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 4 +2\\n\\n9th +4 Brutal Critical (1 die) 4 +3\\n\\n10th +4 Path Feature 4 +3\\n\\n11th +4 Relentless Rage 4 +3\\n\\n12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 5 +3\\n\\n13th +5 Brutal Critical (2 dice) 5 +3\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!

You can use a shield and still gain\\n\\nthis benefit.\\n\\nReckless Attack\\n\\nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can\\n\\ndecide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have\\n\\nadvantage until your next turn.\\n\\nDanger Sense\\n\\nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.\\n\\nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded,\\n\\ndeafened, or incapacitated.\\n\\nPrimal Path\\n\\nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the\\n\\nend of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.\\n\\nAbility Score Improvement\\n\\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability\\n\\nscores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\\n\\nExtra Attack\\n\\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\\n\\nFast Movement\\n\\nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.\\n\\nFeral Instinct\\n\\nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage\\n\\nbefore doing anything else on that turn.\\n\\nBrutal Critical\\n\\nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.\\n\\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.\\n\\nRelentless Rage\\n\\nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds.

When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.\\n\\nPersistent Rage\\n\\nBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.\\n\\nIndomitable Might\\n\\nBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.\\n\\nPrimal Champion\\n\\nAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.\\n\\nPrimal Paths\\n\\nRage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources,\\n\\nhowever. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a\\n\\ntotem animal.\\n\\nPath of the Berserker\\n\\nFor some barbarians, rage is a means to an end — that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As\\n\\nyou enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.\\n\\nFrenzy\\n\\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single\\n\\nmelee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in\\n\\nappendix A).\\n\\nMindless Rage\\n\\nBeginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended\\n\\nfor the duration of the rage.\\n\\nIntimidating Presence\\n\\nBeginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see\\n\\nwithin 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your\\n\\nCharisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away\\n\\nfrom you.\\n\\nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.\\n\\nRetaliation\\n\\nStarting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack\\n\\nagainst that creature.\\n\\nPath of the Totem Warrior\\n\\nThe Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit\\n\\nfills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.\\n\\nIn some barbarians’ tribes, a totem animal is considered to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one\\n\\ntotem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.\\n\\nSpirit Seeker\\n\\nYours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to\\n\\ncast the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals, as described in chapter 10, “Spellcasting.”\\n\\nTotem Spirit\\n\\nAt 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object — an amulet or\\n\\nsimilar adornment — that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes\\n\\nthat are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the\\n\\neagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.\\n\\nYour totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or\\n\\nvulture in place of an eagle.\\n\\nBear. While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any\\n\\npunishment.\\n\\nEagle. While you’re raging, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action\\n\\non your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.\\n\\nWolf. While you’re raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the\\n\\nwolf makes you a leader of hunters.\\n\\nAspect of the Beast\\n\\nAt 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different\\n\\none.\\n\\nBear. You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength\\n\\nchecks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.\\n\\nEagle. You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something\\n\\nno more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.\\n\\nWolf. You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at\\n\\na normal pace (see chapter 8, “Adventuring,” for rules on travel pace).\\n\\nSpirit Walker\\n\\nAt 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for\\n\\nTotem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.\\n\\nTotemic Attunement\\n\\nThe Gri�on's Saddlebag: Book Two has landed on D&D Beyond!
