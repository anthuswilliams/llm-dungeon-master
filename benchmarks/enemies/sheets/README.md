The creatures here were generated by `agents/encounter_designer.py` as of
this git SHA: `8be258e870bd59287cbd222627019c221a2a9e01`, using the following settings:\
```
desert
city
forest
cavern
swamp
crypt
temple
```

They should be consistent with the creatures available in the D&D Monster's Manual; however
this claim is based on on the few entries I have manually double-checked.
